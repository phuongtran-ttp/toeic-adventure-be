Of course I would be happy to write a comment about the job your company completed at my house. I will also post the comment in the “What Customers Are Saying\" section of your company’s Web site. if that is OK with you. <br><br>Here is my comment. “We are so happy we chose Manilo Masonry to install a flagstone patio, a walkway, and an outdoor fireplace at our home. The quality of the craftsmanship is top-notch, and the job was completed three days earlier than the estimated finish date. Mr. Manilo himself was present for every aspect of the project, from the planning stages to final inspection. I intend to use Manilo Masonry again in the future to repave our driveway.\" <br><br> Thanks again for doing such a great job. <br> Hannah Schubert",

I told him that we were more interested in durability than in saving a few dollars‘ Andrew said that you carried both brass and plastic valves, brass for $75 each and plastic for $50 each, both from reliable manufacturers. We knew that the brass are usually good for 6 years. Andrew assured us that the plastic would hold up as well, if not better.<br><br>On Andrew’s recommendation our company purchased 48 plastic automatic sprinkler valves from you. Over the past 3 months the sleeve connecting the top of the valve to the main water pipe has burst or cracked on 12 of the valves. Last Sunday one-third of the lawn was flooded for a full day, since 2 valves broke while our small maintenance crew was out handling a problem in another building across town.<br><br>The result is that besides repairing considerable damage to the lawn (estimates run about $1,000), we will need to replace the 12 valves.<br><br>We are aware that our warranty expired a year ago. However, since the plastic valves were purchased on your recommendation, we think you should be willing to stand behind your work and provide the labor to install brass valves. We are willing to pay for the new valves themselves.<br><br>Sincerely yours,<br>Maria Palmer <br>Maintenance supervisor",
