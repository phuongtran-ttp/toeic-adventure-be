For some people this means long hours in the car and on the highway. <strong>Q1&nbsp;Here are some tips to help you stay safe while on the road. </strong>First, the Do&rsquo;s. If you&rsquo;re traveling with more than one driver, try to switch drivers occasionally so that you don&rsquo;t spend too much time behind the wheel. <strong>Q2&nbsp;Remember to stop frequently and take a break.</strong> Make sure you know the signs of drowsiness: missing road signs, difficulty focusing, and yawning. Now the Don&rsquo;t&rsquo;s. Don&rsquo;t count on distractions such as the radio or an open window to keep you awake. And even though a cup of coffee might give you a lift, remember that the effects of caffeine wear off after a short time. Finally, don&rsquo;t drive between midnight and morning. <strong>Q3&nbsp;Tune in again tomorrow when we&rsquo;ll talk about vacation destinations that both adults and children will enjoy.</strong></p>"

We&rsquo;ve been here for over fifteen years now, and Barker&rsquo;s Books has become an institution. <strong>Q3&nbsp;Being so close to the university, we have the perfect location. </strong>So, imagine my relief when I heard by chance that the shoe store across the road from us is moving out to the new shopping center. I contacted the property manager straight away, and I&rsquo;ve secured a two-year lease from January first on that space with only a modest increase in rent. We&rsquo;ve got a lot of work ahead of us with the move, but I&rsquo;m sure we can handle it.</p>"
