For example, Giordano’s Dessert Shoppe in Wellington has begun selling fruit ices.

        "text": "<h3 align =\"center\"> Matt Alcheri’s Adventurous Leap</h3> <i> By Erika Quade, Badger Dispatch </i> <br>MILWAUKEE (12 January) - Malt Alcheri has created music for dozens of films including <i>Seeking Eleanor</i>, which earned him the Cinearts Award for Best Original Music. Recently, he has lent  his considerable composing skills to Final Chance, a video game produced by Silhouette Gaming Systems (SGS), which has been creating interactive entertainment for 10 years now. <br>Mr. Alcheri was introduced to the managing director of SGS，Harry Jansson, at a social event hosted by Ms. Chandra Bixby who, on occasion, has collaborated with Mr. Alcheri in composing film scores. Mr. Jansson proceeded to invite Mr. Alcheri to write the music for Final Chance. <br>In a phone interview, Mr. Alcheri said that he was “quite impressed” with the graphics and animation of Final Chance. “It left me with the sense that I was watching a movie, and so I did not hesitate to collaborate on the project, said the renowned composer. He further remarked that writing the score for the video game was virtually identical to composing the music for a movie. <br>“All I had to do was write music that matches the atmosphere of the various scenes depicted in the game: he added. <br>As for Mr. Jansson, he said in the same interview that with pre-orders for Final Chance standing currently at 200,000 copies, he has no doubt that the latest SGS product, scheduled to be released on March 20, will be a success.",

The first of the factories, built in Australia's Lonsdale, is the company’s most sizable factory and will eventually be responsible for 55% of the company’s output each year. <br>The new factory has brought with it an increase in jobs for local residents. —[2] —. More than 1,000 construction workers were hired to help build the massive factory and its surrounding structures. <br>Paso Tech's President Goro Hashimoto stated, “This was a major endeavor for our company. When we started this construction project, we realized that it was going to take a lot of money, resources, and staff. – [3] -. Not only did we hire locals to expand the physical plant, but we also added many workers to our full-time payroll. We hope to be able to do the same in Japan. We plan to begin building in Tokyo very soon. The company’s headquarters are currently located in Osaka, Japan. <br>Additional factories will be constructed in some of Paso Tech’s other locations, including in Brazil and South Africa. While the remaining factories will not be as large as the Lonsdale location, they will still require additional resources and labor. —[4] —•",
