        "text": "From: James Bell<br>To: Renaissance Table executive chefs<br>Date: March 20<br>Re: Our twentieth anniversary<br><br>To commemorate the twentieth anniversary of the Renaissance Table restaurant chain, we are assembling a cookbook containing recipes for some of our customers’ favorite dishes. In addition to a selection of recipes for our traditional French dishes and desserts, we would also like to include recipes invented by our chefs especially for the cookbook. The best submissions for original recipes will be included in a special chapter entitled “Kitchen Table Renaissance”<br><br>Bear in mind the following points as you prepare submissions for “Kitchen Table Renaissance”<br><br>- The final book will include a serving guide of dishes that go well together. K your recipe is for a dessert, soup, or other item recommended as a side course, please make sure your submission includes suggestions for main dishes that it would complement.<br>- We are looking for recipes characterized by unique flavors but also commonly available ingredients and methods of preparation familiar to the average amateur cooking enthusiast.<br>- The cost of ingredients and nutritional variety are important, but dishes in this section need to be, above all, easily made by the average person at home in a minimum of time.<br>-  Selected dishes will be photographed later by a professional, so there is no need to include pictures with your submissions.<br><br>All submissions should be sent by e-mail to cookbook@renaissartcetable.com by the end of April. We expect the selection process to take a little over a month, and the authors of the winning recipes will be notified in June. In addition to inclusion in the final cookbook, winning submissions will also be rewarded with a small cash bonus. We expect to have the manuscript prepared by the end of July so that we can publish the collection in time for the restaurant’s anniversary in November.",

        "text": "<p align=\"center\"> <b>A History of Sports from Ancient Times to the Present<br>By Rebecca Jean Porter</b><br>Illustrated, 248 pp.<br>Oakview Press, Westport, CT $32.95</p>Rebecca Jean Porter, the author of Olympic Dreams, has attained another perfect score in this engaging and readable history. A History of Sports from Ancient Times to the Present covers everything from sporting events in ancient Rome to the origins of team sports in North America, and it includes a section on sports played on contemporary university campuses. I highly recommend the chapter with detailed instructions on how to play games that had previously been lost over time. Porter’s comprehensive introduction and bibliography, as well as the time line of dates and events, make this a reference work that should be purchased by all public libraries. An online companion volume will be published next year.<br>- Andrew Huff",
