Industry competitors responded with surprise at the news. -[l]-. And Long Ride motorcycle fans went online en masse to express frustration with Chien Motors for canceling March s much-anticipated roll- out. <br>It seems the decision to equip the Flash JX with a hybrid system, which uses both gasoline and electric power, is to blame. Chien Motors admits that the prototype was rejected because of its excessive size and weight. This design of the power system would have required a larger motorcycle body than planned. They also had concerns over its lack of power output.-[2]- . <br>In addition to the design challenges, the Long Ride factory, having been equipped to produce previous models, is not ready for production of the Flash JX hybrid -[3]- . New equipment will need to be purchased, and the assembly floor will need to be reconfigured. <br>Last year, Chien Motors was widely praised by motorcycle enthusiasts after it stepped in to save Long Ride from going out of business.
