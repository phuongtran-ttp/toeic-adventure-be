Today we will visit two very different but equally impressive exhibits. We&rsquo;ll begin the tour on the first floor with the Susan Willis collection. <strong>Q2&nbsp;This exhibit features life-size statues made of glass. </strong>After a fifteen-minute break, we will proceed to the second floor, where the Karina exhibit is housed. This contains the largest collection of modern sculptures in the world. When our tour is over, we encourage you to visit <strong>Q3&nbsp;the museum gift shop on the third floor, just across from the cafeteria</strong>, where you can purchase coffee and snacks. If you have any questions during our tour, please don&rsquo;t hesitate to ask</p>"

My name is Debra Page and <strong>Q1&nbsp;I&rsquo;ve been a professional chef</strong> with The Seasoned Cook for five years now. In this role, I&rsquo;ve been able to work doing two things I love - cooking and meeting new people. The Seasoned Cook was founded twenty years ago to provide people with kitchen products that reduce both cooking and clean-up time. Tonight I&rsquo;ll be preparing two easy, delicious treats for you. The first is an appetizer that can be made very quickly using several prepared items from the supermarket. The second treat is a <strong>Q2&nbsp;dessert that takes a little bit longer to make,</strong> but is well worth the trouble. As I prepare these dishes, I&rsquo;ll be demonstrating some of our efficient, effective, inexpensive kitchen products for you. <strong>Q3&nbsp;And at the end of the demonstration, we&rsquo;ll all be able to sample the results; then I&rsquo;ll help you place your orders for Seasoned Cook products.</strong></p>"
