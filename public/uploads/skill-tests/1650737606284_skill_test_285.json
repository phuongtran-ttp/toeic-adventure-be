Its print quality is good, and it performs at a reasonable 22-page-per-minute pace. However, with a maximum use limit of 3,600 pages per month. It is not a machine that can withstand heavy use.

During Ms. Inoue’s original eight-year tenure as executive director, the festival became a financial success and achieved international recognition. But interest in the festival has decreased and attendance has dwindled since she stepped down three years ago to take a position as president of the Edinburgh Choir Association.<br><br>Ms. Inoue was bora in Tokyo but grew up in London, where she earned a degree in business. Her interest in the arts eventually led her to the Swansea festival, where she displayed a talent for selecting visual and performing artists who appealed to critics and the general public alike. And while she brought some well-known artists and performers to the festival, she also sought out and promoted new ones.<br><br>Avani. Mitra is one of many who believe this festival was a stepping-stone to a successful career. “I had only played at small, local events before this festival,” Ms. Mitra explained. “Then suddenly I was performing before a large—and very appreciative—crowd. It was wonderful. That experience led to a recording contract.” <br><br>Many in Swansea were shocked by Ms. Inoue’s decision to leave for Edinburgh to help that city’s Choir Association increase its profile. City leaders and festival sponsors hope that her return will bring renewed vitality to the Swansea event and again make it a springboard for new talents in the arts. Michael Brannigan, chief executive officer of festival sponsor Clearview Bank, believes that if anyone can accomplish this goal, it is Ms. Inoue. “She has an instinct that leads her to terrific new performers,” he said. “I’m very glad she’s back.” <br> </td></tr></table>",
