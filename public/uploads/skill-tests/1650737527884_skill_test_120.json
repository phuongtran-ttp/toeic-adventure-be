In order to stay competitive, we must be able to introduce new styles of craft beer to our consumers. Our analysts agree, if the current trend continues, Strange Brew Ales will bump US out of the top five by this time next year. Our master brewers have come up with four new styles of beer that we will introduce to a focus group at the upcoming Northcut Beer Festival. <b> Q2 Once we get consumer feedback we will select the two most popular offerings and create an aggressive marketing campaign</b>. Our sales must increase by at least 5% over the next quarter in order to maintain our market share in Northcut."
