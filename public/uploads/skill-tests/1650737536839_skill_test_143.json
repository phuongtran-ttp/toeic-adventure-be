There are five major shopping centers and a convention center with hotels. A subway and underground passageways connect these buildings with each other and the streets above. The architectural design is appropriate and popular because of the Weather conditions in Toronto. <strong>Q2&nbsp;The temperature fluctuates widely from summer to winter - by as much as 40 degrees Celsius within a year.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Q3 This underground area has also helped to keep business in the city center instead of moving out to the suburbs</strong>, which is happening in many other cities.
