Congreve Advertising is now offering another way for you to reach your customers: automated text messages. We're combining our eye-catching lawn advertisements withe the latest mobile phone technology to create a quick, easy method of increasing your customer base. We're already helped many property rental agents in your area, and we're giving free trials to new users. <br>Our automated text-messaging service involves just a few simple steps. <br>1. Go to our Web site, congreveads,co,au. Click on the Registration page and select New User. You will be guided through our quick and easy registration process, which will allow you to set up an account. <br>2. Once your account is set up, you can start entering the automated responses that you want interested renters to receive. Include the details about each property. You can also add images, audio, and videos, as well as links to Web sites. <br>3. Select a unique keyword for each property. This is what prospective renters will text in order to receive more information about rental. The keyword shouldn't be too long or difficult to spell, and it should be easy for customers to remember. <br>4. Then wait. Apartment seekers will pass by the property and see the keyword. When they text it, they will instantly receive the message you programmed! <br>As part of your free trial, we'll print new rental signs for one of your properties so that your advertisements include the keyword. And, if you contact me by Friday, I'll add two more properties to the order. So, in addition to a month of our text-messaging service, you'll get updated signs for three rental units, all at no cost to you. After the trial period, you can choose from six reasonably priced packages, which include the option of sending daily updates to preferred customers. <br>I look forward to hearing from you! <br>Owen Clement",
