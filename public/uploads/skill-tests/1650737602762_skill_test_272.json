        "text": "The buzz at New York’s premier book fair is all about the upcoming book from poet-turned- novelist Harry s. Tepper. The Nightingales of Fall is the eagerly awaited sequel to his best¬selling debut novel, The Swallows of spring. The book follows the journey of Sally Harknett through the weird world of Underfell, mixing social commentary with sharp wit and just a dash of magic and mystery. Tepper burst onto the scene over a decade ago with the acclaimed poetry collection, King Harmon’s Castle, and the expectation for this latest novel is another chart-topping success. Later this week, the first editions will be made available in a prize drawing at the New York Book Fair, with the official launch at major bookstores next month.",

While most buses stop running by 1:00 A.M., some parts of downtown will see buses running all night. The Bingham shopping district will also see buses running until 3:00 A.M. “This is when we have the most tourists and out-of-town folks coming to visit,” explained Mayor Bill Nate. “We felt it was important to provide the necessary services during this time.” - [3] - When the bus drivers’ union leader, Nathan Reiner, was asked about the new schedules he responded, \"We worked out a payment that is agreeable on both sides and have enough drivers that can work in shifts so that there is no danger of overworking or exhaustion. Many of US will still get some time off during the holidays with our families.” - [4] –",

He had publicly indicated his desire to retire in order to write a memoir of his long career in fashion, over thirty years of which were spent at Hochstein. Nevertheless, most experts had expected him to stay on until after November, when the company's winter collection is released. <br><br>Ferrara's move has generated much speculation about who will take her place at Barrault Bondy. Sources there indicate that current design director Marcel Hugo will be named the new executive vice president in a press release later this week.",

I know of no other non-profit organization that performs such a vital service for all-natural agriculture as yours does, and I am enthusiastic about the prospect of the Crocket Center working with Integral Harvest. <br><br>As you know, the Crockett Center has recently turned its attention to urban gardening. On this front, the main priorities are to expand existing community gardens in Austin and to found new ones in neighborhoods currently lacking them. Therefore, I would like to proceed with the gardening classes we discussed in our meeting, to be taught on-site by Integral Harvest representatives and attended by Austin community residents. If you will let me know your representatives' availability for teaching the classes and also the range of topics they will cover, I can prepare a class schedule and generate interest in it among residents. My assistant, Cindy Reed, will call you shortly for this information. <br><br>As for your proposal that Integral Harvest representatives demonstrate organic gardening to elementary school students here in Austin, since our meeting I have spoken with several school administrators. It seems that a number of the schools have gardening clubs, so students and teachers alike should make a receptive audience. Let us discuss this proposal further in our next meeting, which Ms. Reed will schedule. <br><br>I am sure that, if our two organizations work together, we can do much to promote urban gardening as a rewarding and healthful endeavor. <br><br>Yours sincerely, <br><br>Letitia Price, Executive Director<br>Crockett Center for Community Development",
