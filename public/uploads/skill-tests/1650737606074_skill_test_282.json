This airline, a long-time favorite of the budget traveler, offers discounted, round- trip airfares to popular destinations like Madrid, Amsterdam, Paris, and Rome. But we especially like the great deals to Germany. These are the lowest available fares on the market at hundreds of dollars less than other advertised fall airline prices. <br><br>Flier’s Choice offers these fares between September 23 and November 30, but you must make a reservation by August 5 to receive these low prices. For more information on specific destinations and fares, visit our magazine’s Web site at www.travelersplus.com. <br><br>Check back in next month’s issue for great deals on hotels in Japan’s most popular destinations.",
