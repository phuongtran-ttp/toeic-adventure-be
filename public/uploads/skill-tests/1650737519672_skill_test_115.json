I was wondering if you would like to play volleyball with us on Saturday afternoon.<br /> M: Uh... it sounds like fun, but I have to tell you, <strong>Q1&nbsp;I am really out of shape. I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;m not much of an athlete these days.</strong><br /> W: That&rsquo;s all right. <strong>Q2&nbsp;We just play to socialize, have some fun, and get a little exercise.</strong> Don&rsquo;t worry about it - we&rsquo;re not professionals! We&rsquo;d love to have you on the team, and we really could use you on Saturday - one of our players was injured during the last game.<br /> M: In that case then, <strong>Q3&nbsp;I&rsquo;ll see you at the gym.</strong></p>"
