The session is so full that it had to be moved from the Magnolia Lounge to Ballroom A. Also, there has been a time change for the luncheon for the association&rsquo;s outgoing president, James Dixon. It will be held at one o&rsquo;clock, instead of twelve o&rsquo;clock. <strong>Q3&nbsp;Any additional changes to the conference program will be posted on the board near the registration desk in the hotel lobby. </strong>So please check there from time to time.</p>"
