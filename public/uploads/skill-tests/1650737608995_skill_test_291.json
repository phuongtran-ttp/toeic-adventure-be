        "text": "<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"> Tips for Your Photographs </h3> <br>Maintaining the quality and integrity of photographs is important because photographs are our visual record of the past. By following a few important guidelines, you can ensure that your photographs last a lifetime. <br><br>If photographs are to be displayed, make sure they are placed in frames that have ultraviolet-resistant glass. Exposure to the Sun’s ultraviolet rays can cause colors to fade and can cause black-and-white photographs to turn yellow. In addition, they should be placed in frames that allow space between the glass and the top surface of the photograph. The surface of the photograph can deteriorate if it is in constant contact with glass. <br><br>When storing photographs in albums, make sure the albums contain acid-free paper. Colored paper or magnetic pages should never be used. To store photographs in boxes, use boxes made of metal or acid-free cardboard. Store albums and boxes in a dry environment, as humidity can quickly destroy photographs. <br><br>Finally, be careful when <u>handling</u> photographs, especially historic ones. If you must touch a photograph, your hands should be clean. Skin naturally produces oil, which can be harmful to photographs. You should pick up photographs only by the edges  and should wear clean cotton gloves.",
