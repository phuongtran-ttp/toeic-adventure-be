I’m going to move up to the next floor in about twenty minutes. </b> Are you finished with Raptas’ window? <br> M:  Hi, Batty. Yeah, I have finished Raptas’ and I’m going upstairs to the next floor. The windows are already pretty clean up there so I think we can get the job done pretty soon. <br>W:  Great. Before you start on the 4th floor, can you please bring me some more window cleaner? I have run out. <br>M: Sure, I’ll be up in about twenty minutes. It will be good to see how clean your windows are compared to mine. <b> Q3 When we are finished with the windows, we need to start on the carpets.</b>"
