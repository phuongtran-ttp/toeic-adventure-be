But <b> Q1&2 I think we can reduce our heating costs by starting to purchase and install new energy-efficient heaters next quarter</b>. To tell us more about these heaters, <b> Q3 I'd like to introduce Jeff Smith who's a consultant from Johnstown Energy</b>. Jeff's here to answer any questions you may have. <br>"
