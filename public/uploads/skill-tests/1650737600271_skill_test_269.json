The whole premise of the idea came up after Rachel and Robert Burnelle had their first child. Both working parents had constantly turned to fastfood for their meals and realized that many of their friends did as well. They wanted healthier options which most fast-food fanchises don&rsquo;t provide. - [2] - The business is so popular that they have been getting orders from outside the city. &ldquo;The response has been overwhelming,&quot; says Rachel. &ldquo;Our customers especially appreciate the freshness and quality of our meals.&rdquo; Janet, a customer from the start added, &ldquo;Not only is the food healthy, it&rsquo;s not that much more expensive than fast-food meals, but it&rsquo;s much better for you.&rdquo; - [3] -<br /> The Burnelles say they are planning to expand their delivery routes and open three Farm-to-Table grocery shops with ready-made meals around the city of Grandview within the next year. - [4] &ndash;</p>",

Therefore, I am urging all of our employees to take part in the upcoming community park cleanup sponsored by the city of Harrisburg. Without the dedication of volunteers, our parks and public spaces would not be free of litter. Donate some of your free time to keeping Harrisburg a beautiful and inviting city. <br> The community park cleanup will be held next Friday, February 18, from 1:00 to 5:00 P.M. Employees who wish to participate will leave work at lunchtime, yet will still be paid as if they had worked a full day. Volunteers are asked to bring supplies such as protective outerwear, tools, insect repellent, trash bags, and snacks. <br> A shuttle bus will depart from the company parking lot at 1:20 P.M. on Friday to take volunteers to the volunteer location. If you have a specific preference concerning the type of work you would like to do, please contact Event Organizer Don Lewis at 435- 555-6768. <br> We appreciate everyone’s enthusiasm and support. <br>Fred Hanes<br> Human Resources, Joint Systems",
