        "text": "<h4 align =\"center\"> MEMO</h4>From: Harumi Ohta, Kitchen Manager <br>To: All Staff<br><br>It is essential that all food handlers practice good personal hygiene throughout the year, but it is especially important during the upcoming cold and flu season. Viruses can be carried on hands, linger on work surfaces such as countertops and cutting boards, and find their way onto utensils and plates. Therefore, all employees who work with food must wash their hands before handling any food or utensils used in the preparation or delivery of food. <br>Instructions on the proper method for washing your hands are posted at the entrance to the kitchen, in the restrooms, and in the meeting room next to the lobby. Please follow them diligently. <br><br>Harumi.",

The new desks are due to arrive on 20 October. --- [1] ---. I have requested that the delivery occur early in the morning before office hours so it does not interrupt our work. --- [2] ---. To make the transition go faster, please move the contents of your current desk, including personal items, into a cardboard box on the 19th. <br>You can read more about the model we've ordered at wilsonofficefurniture.com/hybrid56. --- [3] ---. My research showed this one to be the most user-friendly option. The height of the desk can be changed by simply flipping a latch and pushing a button. <br>Many of you have been requesting hybrid desks for some time now, so I am glad we are able to make this happen. This is only one of the changes management plans to implement this year in our efforts to make Holmana a healthier and happier workplace. --- [4] ---.<br><br>Best regards, <br>Robin Ruiz</td></tr></table>",
