That’s more expensive than I thought it would be. Our budget was three thousand dollars. Why is the price so high? <br>M2: <b> Q2 I can explain why the price is over your budget</b>. It is because the old paint is peeling badly in some areas. We have to remove it all before repainting, which takes a long time. If you had repainted it earlier it would be less expensive. <br>M1:  In the future I would recommend painting it every 7 years. <br>W: OK. I thought I was being over charged, but that makes sense. <b> Q3 You can go ahead and begin painting on the first weekend of August.</b>"
