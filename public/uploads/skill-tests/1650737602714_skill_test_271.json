Within just a couple of hours of opening the doors, most of the Bucci design items were sold out. Similar reports of chaos and empty shelves which once held items from the Bucci line were echoed in major cities around the world including New York, London, Tokyo, and Milan. - [2] - Although B&G has released limited edition collaborations with other famous designers, this is the first time that B&G shops have reported a complete depletion of items within hours of its release. The Bucci and B&G collaboration is the most successful to date and, already, talks are in progress over future collaborations for more clothing lines. - [3] - Meanwhile in Seoul, shoppers who were unable to purchase from the Bucci line were disappointed but excited to have the popular retailer open in Korea. - [4] –",
