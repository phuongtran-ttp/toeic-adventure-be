Sorry to interrupt, but <b> Q1 I’ve got a management meeting tomorrow about expenses for next quarter</b>, and …I’m waiting for the department budget proposal. <br>W-Br: I  just finished. The only issue is with the estimated cost of office supplies for next year. Based on the requests I’ve received, <b> Q2 we'll need to increase our office supply spending by quite a bit.</b><br>M-Cn:  Oh, that's not good. There's not very much flexibility for increasing our spending right now. <b> Q3 I’ll bring this up at the meeting. Let's see what the other managers think about trying to renegotiate our contracts with the vendors we buy office supplies from</b>. Hopefully we can get lower rates."
