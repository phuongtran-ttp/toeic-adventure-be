        "text": "----------------- <br><br>Samuels Ltd. announced on Monday that it will spend $1 billion to build nylon production and processing facilities in Singapore to serve the Asia Pacific region. Construction of the 45,000-square-meter plant will take two years. When the factory is complete, it will employ over 500 workers and have an estimated annual production of 60,000 tons of nylon and nylon components. According to company spokesperson Michael Tan, the plant will be equipped with the same advanced technology used in Samuels plants in India and Canada, enabling the company to price its nylon competitively. The nylon products will be sold to companies throughout the region for use in various industrial textile applications. <br><br>The Asia Pacific market for nylon has remained strong over the last decade, with the majority of purchases coming from the automobile manufacturers. Samuels is hoping that the efficient production from the new factory will position it to become a leader in the market. It will face stiff competition from Haring Corporation, the current leader, and from several other large chemical companies that ship nylon products into the area from Europe and Africa. <br> <br> -----------------",

        "text": "<table width=\"100%\" border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0> <tr> <td> <h3>TECHNOLOGY NEWS: </h3> <br> The new Washwave ultrasonic home dishwasher developed by the Dowell Company is a great way to clean dishes and benefit the environment. The Washwave removes debris from dishes using ultrasonic waves in the same way that that can be used to clean jewelry. The dishwasher contains a 100-liter tank with two metal converters that release high-frequency sound waves under water. The waves generate high- temperature, high-pressure bubbles that clean dishes using very little detergent. These micro-scrubbing bubbles can reach into small cracks and crevices that sponges or brushes cannot reach. <br><br>A conventional machine consumes 200 to 300 liters of fresh water per use. The Washwave filters the water in its tank for reuse after each cycle. The water in its tank only needs to be changed every other week. This can save the average household 250,000 to 500,000 liters of water annually. The shorter run time of the machine also saves on electricity. The Washwave cleaning cycle lasts only five minutes where a conventional machine usually takes twenty minutes or longer.<br><br>The Washwave unit was introduced in Japan in September, and Dowell is planning to introduce it around the world over the next several years. Dowell is also able to customize dishwashers to meet the needs of commercial clients such as those in the healthcare and hospitality industries. For more information, visit www.dowell.com to see demonstration videos, order a brochure, or find a local retailer. </td></tr> </table>",

The hotel’s Jade Restaurant has hired a new executive chef, cooking expert and chef extraordinaire Mei-Yi Gan. Gan, who took over the restaurant last month, has already made her mark by adding some of her signature dishes to the menu. <br><br>Gan has most recently worked as head chef at Hong Kong’s four-star restaurant Room at the Top but is best known for her previous work as editor of East and West, a cooking magazine with an impressive international circulation. Gan studied under Master Chef Chun-Yuen Li, who praised Gan for being “a culinarily gifted student” and possessing “excellent instincts.” <br><br>So far, the Palais Hotel has been aptly nicknamed. Staying in one of the luxurious rooms, or dining at the sophisticated Jade Restaurant, one gets a sense of experiencing something special, something still undiscovered. Based on the meals that Gan has produced there so far, we predict that the addition of this exceptional chef will serve to bring the hidden jewel out of hiding. <br><br>",

Avoid multisurface cleaners, as these may leave streaks or an oily residue.<br>• To brighten a surface that has dulled, use a paste wax such as Russ Wax. Apply the wax no more than twice per year. Remove the old wax first with a mild, nonalkaline soap-and-water solution.<br>• Avoid wiping the furniture with a dry cloth, as this may leave hairline scratches on the finish.<br>• Avoid placing the furniture directly in front of radiators, heating ducts, and fireplaces.<br>• Do not expose the furniture to direct sunlight, as this may lead to fading.<br><br>We wish you a lifetime of enjoyment from your furniture.
