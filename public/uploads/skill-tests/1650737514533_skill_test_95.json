However, I have a similar model that you could look at. The car is used, but it is in great shape and just had new tires put on it. <br>W: Oh, that’s too bad that you already sold the model. <b> Q2 That car had a really good safety rating, which is what I consider most important when buying a car.</b> <br>M: I see. Well, this similar model also has a five-star safety rating. <b> Q3 Why don’t you come here this week? You can take a look at it and take it for a test drive.</b>"
