Does anyone know how that happened? <br><b> Luke Ciccone, 8:33 A.M. </b><br>I set the timer right before locking the door yesterday afternoon. The lights should have shut off at 6 P.M. <br><b> Analia Rue, 8:35 A.M. </b><br>I drove by the store on my way home from the post office around 6:30, and the lights were off. <br><b> Filiz Budak, 8:37 A.M. </b><br>OK. Since this has happened the last three mornings, there's definitely a problem with the timer. <br><b> Jae Woo Han, 8:38 A.M. </b><br>I left with Luke at 5 and saw him set the timer. <br><b> Luke Ciccone, 8:42 A.M. </b><br>I agree. The lights are turning on before they are scheduled to. I'll call a repair service when I get to work for my shift. Rex Repair is always reliable. <br><b> Filiz Budak, 8:48 A.M. </b><br>Contact the company that did the installation. The paperwork should be in one of the filing cabinets. And until the timer can be fixed, the last person on duty will have to turn off each light before closing. <br><b> Jae Woo Han, 8:50 A.M. </b><br>Yes, I remember filling their invoice at the time of the installation. <br><b> Luke Ciccone, 8:51 A.M. </b> <br>Will do.",

Abigail Hurst, who opened the original Woodcraft Designs location on High Street five years ago, leads a small team of experienced, talented furniture makers whose unique creations will be displayed in both stores. Although Hurst’s pieces cover a range of styles and periods, the new store will showcase the company’s remarkable replicas of Victorian-style furniture made from fine quality cherry, oak, and mahogany woods.<br><br>Hurst’s craftwork has earned her a reputation as a master artisan in her field. Her reconstruction of a nineteenth-century dressing table was the subject of a lengthy article in Classics of Woodwork on methods and techniques of precision woodcutting. In addition, photographs of some of her best pieces have appeared in Today’s Space, which features information about houses and buildings that are known for their impressive furnishings and decor. Ms. Hurst will divide her time between the old and new store locations.",

As you know, we consider it one of our highest priorities to keep our longtime customers up-to-date on all changes or improvements in the services we provide. For this reason, we are writing to inform you of some changes to our pricing policies that may affect your business.<br><br>Beginning on February 20, the rate for international calls placed during regular business hours will increase from 14 cents per minute to 16 cents per minute. Also, the rate for all other international calls will be raised, from 9 cents per minute to 11 cents per minute.<br><br>In addition, local calls during business hours will no longer cost 5 cents per minute. Instead, they will be 6 cents per minute. However, all other rates will remain the same. Please also note that regular business hours are defined as 8 A.M. to 6 P.M., Monday through Friday.<br><br>We wish to assure you that these changes are necessary and that we are committed to providing the best possible service to all our customers. As one measure taken to ensure that our service remains of the highest quality, we recently refurbished several of our communications receivers, which has improved the clarity of telephone calls on the Valsen Lines network. Moreover, on March 15, we will set up a new customer service call center that will help reduce the amount of time customers have to wait to speak to a representative. These and other planned improvements over the next few months are our way of showing you that we at Valsen Line value your continued business.<br><br>Sincerely,<br>Rashna Richards<br>Vice President, Customer Relations",
