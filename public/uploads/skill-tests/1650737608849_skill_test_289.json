Ashland Foods was the highest bidder in a two-month¬long bidding war in which Belltown Foods was the other major contender. Hugh Tran, CEO of Addison May, said in a statement to Business Daily, “We are confident in the vision Ashland Foods has for our company and are sure that the integrity of our products will remain intact.” <br><br>Ashland Foods CEO Anna Baum said that “with the acquisition of Addison May, Ashland Foods expects to become an even' bigger global competitor in emerging markets such as Latin America and China.” <br><br>Addison May was founded 75 years ago. In the past 5 years, it has undergone two restructurings and has downsized its product line to 18 core products. The company is known for its Meals for Two line of frozen dinners, as well as for its Bakery Delights line of frozen pastries. Because of its strong brand recognition, the Addison May name and logo will still appear on the front of its packaging. On the back, the labels will read “Produced and distributed by Ashland Foods.” <br><br>The acquisition is set to take place on May 1. There has been no statement regarding the impact the acquisition will have on Addison May’s 17,000 employees worldwide. <br><br>In response to the news of the acquisition, Ashland Foods’ stock rose 5 percent yesterday.",

        "text": "<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"> Theater Comes Back to Life </h3> <br>(September 1 marks the beginning of the twentieth theatrical season at Shoreline Playhouse in Meadow Lakes, an event that just one year ago few thought would ever take place. <br><br>Over the past three years the Playhouse has seen its share of troubles. The opening of Field Theater in nearby Mooreland City meant that Shoreline Playhouse was no longer the only destination for area theatergoers. In addition, the generous grants given to Field Theater by the Walters Foundation meant larger-scale productions there that had a broader appeal. Shoreline Playhouse found itself operating at a loss, with little idea of what the future would hold. <br><br>Proud of its long theater heritage, the town of Meadow Lakes decided it would not be outdone by Mooreland City. The town stepped in and purchased the Lake Drive property on which the Playhouse stands. The town leased the property back to the Playhouse for the next 25 years as a hands-off landlord. In addition, town residents <u>raised</u>  a significant amount of money in donations through their Save Our Playhouse campaign. <br><br>These efforts have paid off enormously. Milton Shaffer, executive director of Shoreline Playhouse, says that “because of what the town has done for us, we are now able to offer our best season yet, We have big names in theater who will grace our stage this season, including actors William Farr, Eva Johnson, and Clyde Wells, and musical theater luminaries Mary Noda and Henry Formann.” Shaffer goes on to add, “We have a great lineup of theatrical productions with broad intergenerational appeal, such as Angela DiFalco’s classic play <i>Two Floors Down</i>, Beth Heard’s <i>Windswept Lane</i>, Blanca Flores’ <i>Far Away Home</i>, and Anthony Ward’s new musical <i>Stepping Out of Time</i>, which will make its debut here at Shoreline Playhouse.” <br><br>The sigh of relief around Meadow Lakes is almost audible. The Shoreline Playhouse can now concentrate on what it does best, enriching the area with firstclass theater productions. As resident May Gramercy puts it, “Art, whether it’s visual art, music, or theater, is necessary for a good life. We’d never let our town be without it.”",

More and more of them are being asked to wait a week or longer for service from a repair crew. It seems that our customer base has expanded more quickly than projected, and technical support requests have increased by about 30 percent. This means that the number of technicians available to assist customers is now insuffcient.<bR><bR>The committee feels an expansion of the repair team is necessary to restore customer satisfaction. We are expecting even more customers to have our equipment installed in their homes, and with the present number of technical crews, we may not be able to handle their service needs.
