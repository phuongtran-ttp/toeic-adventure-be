        "text": "MILAN, Italy—Few industries change as rapidly as the fashion industry, in which designers are constantly trying to create innovative versions of traditional garments. Even so, last week's fashion show in Milan was particularly notable for the vast number of garments made partly or entirely out of silk. From eveningwear to sportswear, many designers featured colorful silks in their collections.<br><br>The designers were likely responding to a market trend: a dramatically increased demand for colorful silk products. “Our sales of silk shirts and dresses have reached an all-time high,” said Christina Alvarez, a buyer for Gatsby’s in London. “Silk items have been flying off the racks.”<br><br>Economic analysts were surprised by the trend, since they had predicted that the rise of dry-cleaning costs would take a toll on silk manufacturers. However, comfort may have been a greater factor than price, especially given the unusually hot weather this past summer. “Today’s silk garments,” said Ms. Alvarez, “are lighter and cooler than many other types of clothing.”",

        "text": "5 February—The construction of the long- awaited Alitas International Airport has been completed. The airport is intended to relieve overcrowding at Garas Regional Airport, and government officials hope that the new facility will further contribute to the growth of tourism on the island of Ponta Mira.<br><br>In recent years, new hotels have appeared in Mona City, Ponta Mira’s capital, and the island has seen an increase in the number of tourists. However, the growth of tourism had been hampered by the fact that, because of its proximity to the water, Garas Regional Airport cannot be expanded to accommodate an increased volume of traffic.<br><br>Additionally, long lines in crowded ticketing and baggage areas and lack of space in waiting areas of the terminal were noted by travelers as reasons to avoid the airport. While the island can be reached by ferry, this option is available only from the seaside cities of Port-de-Bastique and Reolas. Tourists have to fly to one of these destinations and then embark on a sea journey that takes at least 90 minutes.<br><br>Lipali was chosen as the site for the new airport because it is away from the city, providing ample room for a spacious facility, complete with several eateries, comfortable waiting areas, expanded ticketing areas, and Internet access.<br><br>Travelers using the new Alitas International Airport can easily get to and from the facility by bus or car. Moreover, to increase access, an express railway connection between Mona City and the new airport is under construction, with expectations that it will be fully functional before the end of the year.",
