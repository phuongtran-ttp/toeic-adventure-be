The Expo will take place at the Sao Paulo Event Center from June 3 to June 5. More than 2,000 small-business entrepreneurs will attend workshops and showcase their businesses at booths, where visitors can collect information and ask questions. <br><br>According to an SPSBE press release, Mr. Azevedo will highlight many of the ideas from his best-selling book Keys to Startup Success, published just last year. Mr. Azevedo believes that there are several  key decisions that must be made before launching into any new business scheme. “You can’t go into it with the idea of creating a product you want to sell”，Mr. Azevedo writes in his book. “You have to create a product people want to buy. This is rule number one. And it is absolutely essential to get this right if you want your business to succeed.’’ <br><br>Mr. Azevedo is the owner of several successful businesses in Los Angeles, where he has lived for the past ten years. “I’m originally from Sao Paulo,” Mr. Azevedo said. “So I wanted to help the community where I got my start in any way I could, which is why I accepted the invitation to participate in the Expo. There’s an outstanding opportunity there for small- business owners. Following these simple but important guidelines has worked well for me and for many other successful small- business owners,” <<br><br> Tickets to the Expo are RSI00. They can be purchased through the Expo’s Web site at www.saopauloexpo.com/br.",
