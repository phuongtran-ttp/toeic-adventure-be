The interior design specialist just gave us some recommendations for our office layout. We don't need to purchase anything new, just rearrange a few things. <br>W:  Oh really? What did he say? <br>M: <b> Q2 He suggested that we move the help desk and the sales desk so that they are on opposite sides of the entrance. That way, if we have people waiting in line they won’t be crowded. Q3 We will just slide the sales desk to where the waiting area is now.</b> <br>W: That is a good idea, and this way, when people come into the office they can see all of our products displayed against the back wall. <br>M:  Exactly, and then after they purchase their items they can just step out the door. Glad we are already on the same page. <br>W: Well, I think we should start moving the sales desk right away, don’t you?"
