It listed the end of our half-price sale as December 11 instead of December 1. While a correction will appear in the paper's next issue, it is to be expected that not all of our customers will be aware of the error. Therefore, if shoppers ask between December 2 and 11 about the sale, first apologize for the inconvenience and then offer them a coupon for 10% off any item they wish to purchase, either in the store or online. <br>Should customers have any further questions, please direct them to the floor manager. Thank you for your assistance in this matter. <br><br>Clifford Shein, General Manager, Williams Apparel",

Beginning in November, she will be general manager of City Wheels, a bike-sharing company in Auckland. — [2]—. The move comes at an opportune moment for both Ms. Haas and City Wheels. Ms. Haas had worked for Gear Good in Wellington since the company was founded five years ago but was yearning to return to Auckland, where she grew up. City Wheels was looking for a new leader to oversee its planned expansion from 50 to 75 bike stations in Auckland. —[3] —. “I’m thrilled to join a company that’s important to residents and tourists alike,” Ms. Haas said. <br>The City Wheels system is simple and affordable for occasional use. —[4] —. The first thirty minutes of biking are free, and after that, the cost is $4 per hour or $20 per day. Ms. Haas said she is enthusiastic about this venture, both for herself and for the city of Auckland. - Tahei Davis, Staff Writer",

The project is estimated to cost $1,6 billion, and a new terminal is scheduled to open for international service in approximately one year. <br>The airport, however, sits on a confined piece of land, which presents significant challenges to increasing the number of takeoffs and landings. If the airport remains limited to its current two runways, the capacity to handle air traffic could be reached within three years. <br>To address the problem, officials overseeing the Onalia City Airport project have contracted a group of engineers from Wilford Engineering to explore the possibility of extending a third runway over the Pacific Ocean. The engineering firm will survey the area for six months before presenting their findings and recommending a plan of action. <br>Runways that extend over water are not unprecedented. This type of runway exists in places such as Gibraltar and Japan, which have faced similar challenges.",
