The speed of social media, as well as its relative inexpensiveness, make it an attractive option for small companies that can&#39;t rely on television or magazine advertising to reach new customers. And most sites can be managed without the help of a technology expert. For reaching larger, more general audiences, &mdash; [1]&mdash; .<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But even though social media offers many opportunities, you should not try to promote your business on as many outlets as possible. Managing information on several networks can quickly become a full-time job and can make it harder, not easier, to control your message. &mdash; [2]&mdash;. Therefore, it is important that you learn the benefits and limitations of each social media platform, and then decide which one or two are best suited to your target customers. &mdash; [3]&mdash; .<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Different platforms focus on different kinds of content, like photos, videos, short messages, or blogs. Some platforms need to be updated frequently, with customers expecting you to post new material every day. &mdash; [4]&mdash;. Certain platforms are better for reaching larger, more general audiences, while some allow you to focus on a specific group of customers. So before you set up accounts on every available platform, think about your business needs and your customer base.</div>",

The new chain will be managed from Metro-Edibles&#39; Hong Kong headquarters, and the multinational corporation hopes to eventually introduce 200 Soup and Salad Central locations throughout Asia and Europe.<br /> &nbsp;&ldquo;The convenience food sector has shown worldwide growth over the last decade,&quot; remarked Louis Merkey, industry analyst at Businesstrend.com. &ldquo;Metro-Edibles is wisely taking advantage of this trend.&rdquo;<br /> A survey conducted by Metro-Edibles over the last year revealed that consumers are choosing to purchase more wholesome foods when eating out. Neha Ramisetty, Metro-Edibles&#39; top executive, noted that the industry in general is placing less emphasis on fried foods and focusing more on fresh ingredients and nutritional value.<br /> &ldquo;We are offering this approach too, at an average price of US $7.50 for a lunch or dinner, with cheaper options for breakfast and snacks,&quot; said Ms. Ramisetty. &ldquo;Furthermore, we will cater mostly to urban residents with faster-paced lifestyles. So we think that they will appreciate the convenience that our menu will offer.&rdquo;<br /> Metro-Edibles Corp. is optimistic that Soup and Salad Central, its newest subsidiary, will start to turn profits by its second year of operations. The corporation still carries some long-term debt from money it borrowed to start current enterprises.</span></p>",
