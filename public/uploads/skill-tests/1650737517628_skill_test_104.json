You’ll need to monitor the battery closely. Always check the display screen. <br>M-Cn: When do I change the batteries? <br>W-Br: In your trainee manual, you can see how the battery-power levels will appear on the display. <b> Q3 Replace batteries when they reach twenty-five percent</b>. We don’t want to replace them any earlier than we have to, but we can-t wait until they run out or we may lose valuable data."
