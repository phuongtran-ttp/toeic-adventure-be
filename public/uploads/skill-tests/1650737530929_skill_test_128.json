I’m calling because I’m writing an article about the new production your theater is putting on this weekend. <b>Q2 I saw on your Web site that you don’t allow photography during the performance, and I was wondering whether you’d be willing to make an exception – I’d really like to take some pictures of the sets and actors to publish with my article. Q3 If not, I could come to one of your dress rehearsals</b>. I’ll be out of town tomorrow morning for a celebrity interview, but I’m free to attend a rehearsal any other time this week.
