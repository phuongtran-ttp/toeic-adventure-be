Laurie comes to us by way of the accounting division, her home for the last twelve years. Laurie and I worked together there during my early days in the company, shortly after she joined the accounting area. She is an energetic colleague and a highly competent manager. Laurie's first day with us here in the quality control and packaging department will be July 29. <br><br>We are very happy that Alfred Chen has agreed to continue to serve in an interim capacity as assistant coordinator of packaging until we are able to find a replacement for Lydia Parry. Alfred has helped the packaging department immensely this summer by preparing schedules, responding to e-mails, and entering material into the database in Lydia's place. We would have been lost without him. In the meantime, colleagues in the human resources division are working to fill Lydia's position. I will send out an update as soon as an offer is accepted. <br><br>Finally, please join me in congratulating Karl Wilson on his recent <u>appointment</u> as coordinator of quality control. I look forward to working with Karl in his new role. <br><br>Thanks, <br>David Briggs<br>Senior Vice President<br>Quality Control and Packaging<br>",

It is designed to handle large volumes and can be customized for almost any size or shape of food product. <br><br>Certain Seal also lengthens the shelf life of your products. As you know, one of the biggest causes of food spoilage is excess air left in vacuum- sealed packages. Our system is especially effective in eliminating this threat. In the September issue of <i>Industry World</i> magazine, comparison testing indicated that Certain Seal removed excess air more efficiently than similar vacuum packaging systems (such as the Sigillare 100 produced by TYT Industries). <br><br>Food quality is ensured further by the packaging material itself. For the Certain Seal system, we use an especially durable plastic that protects foods throughout the freezing, shipping, and reheating processes. <br><br>This is just an overview of some of the benefits of our technology. I will go into greater detail in my October 28 presentation at your office. In order to tailor the presentation to your needs, I would like to know more about Home Country’s production requirements. Please contact me at our main offices in Oakland at (510) 555-0116 between 9 A.M. and 6 P.M. <br><br>Sincerely, <br>Julie Chan Sales Director",

You should read this part of the manual even if you have used a cash register before. The following is the basic setup procedure; more detailed information is provided in the <u>succeeding</u> sections beginning on page 13. <br><br> <b>1.UNPACK THE CASH REGISTER</b>. Remove the machine from its box and makes sure that all of the parts and accessories are included. A full inventory of accessories and attachments is provided on page 4.<br><br><b>2.REMOVE THE PROTECTIVE PACKAGING</b>. Carefully remove the tape holding the parts of the cash register in place. Then remove the small plastic bag taped to the printer compartment. This is where you will find the keys for adjusting the printer settings.<br><br><b> 3.INSTALL THE MEMORY BACKUP BATTERIES</b>. Remove the lid from the printer compartment on the top of the machine (Diagram C). Remove the battery compartment cover by sliding the cover toward you and then pulling up. Note the (+) and (-) markings in the battery compartment. Load the enclosed set of three new UM-3 batteries so that their positive (+) and negative (-) ends are facing as indicated by the markings. Replace the battery compartment cover. NOTE; These batteries protect transaction information stored in your register’s memory when there is a power failure or when you unplug the power adaptor. Be sure to install these batteries before using the machine.<br><br><b>4.INSTALL RECEIPT PAPER</b>. Remove the printer lid. Open the platen arm. Lower the roll into the space behind the printer, ensuring that the paper is being fed from the bottom of the roll (see Diagram D.) Put the leading end of the paper over the printer. Close the platen arm slowly until it locks securely. Replace the printer cover, passing the leading end of the paper through the cutter slot. Tear off the excess paper and then close the printer lid. NOTE: When all provided paper rolls have been used, you can order a replacement pack from an approved supplier. A full list of outside suppliers of receipt paper is provided on page 46.<br><br><p align =\"center\"> -page5- </td></tr> </table>",

At both companies, additional production facilities will be built and staff sizes increased. <br><br>In order to focus on alternative energy sources such as ocean power, Aucoin-Braud will establish an additional subsidiary in another international <u>market</u>. When pressed by reporters to specify which, Roux declined to say, stating only that “Northern Europe has much potential in this respect and is important to our long-term goals.” <br><br>For industry analyst Dieter Veidt, this comes as no surprise. “Aucoin-Braud has invested heavily in ocean power technology, so Northern European nations like Denmark or Finland are perfect venues for the firm’s expansion.” <br><br>Roux’s final comment at the press conference will undoubtedly fuel speculation on this point. When asked what her short-term goals were, she replied that she is “planning a seaside vacation in Denmark.”",

As you know, making hard copies requires the use of paper, toner, and other materials that impact the environment. It can also be expensive. Currently, departments are charged 5 cents per page, which can add up quickly. To minimize these environmental and financial impacts, consider accessing materials electronically whenever possible. <br>When hard copies are truly necessary, please limit your use of the copy machine to 25 copies per batch. This machine is intended for light use, and printing large batches could result in excessive wear and added maintenance and replacement costs. If a higher number of copies is needed, please submit a request to the Printing Center, located on the fourth floor. We have discontinued the paper printing request form and now only process orders from our electronic form on the employee resources Web page. Please contact your department secretary if you need assistance with this procedure. <br><br>Thank you for your cooperation. <br>Regards, <br>Joan Frinkel<br>Operations Supervisor",

        "text": "It is no secret that Xiaoyu Li's latest book, Daring to Succeed in Business (276 pages, Finn Business Publishing, $26.95), was written specifically for recent university graduates. The book is heavily marketed to young people, and much of the book's introductory material is geared toward them. However, the concepts elucidated by Ms. Li are reflected in the experiences of many an established business executive. --- [1] ---. The basic premise of the book is that in order to fulfill one's true potential, a person must be willing to take calculated risks. As founder and CEO of a large advertising firm, I can attest to this idea. <br>Taking risks was not something I learned to do overnight. --- [2] ---. In fact, I spent the early years of my career firmly in my comfort zone, avoiding any major decisions that did not have a predictable outcome. What I eventually realized is that by doing this, I was effectively preventing my business from growing to its true potential. --- [3] ---. It was not until I started pursuing new opportunities strategically and stopped worrying about the occasional mistake that my company developed into the multimillion-dollar firm it is today. It was a change in mindset that make all the difference, but it took me years to figure out. <br>For this reason, I am particularly pleased that Ms. Li is presenting this idea to those who may become the business leaders of tomorrow. --- [4] ---. In twelve clear and engaging chapters, Ms. Li narrates the experiences of several of today's big names in business. Each chapter choses with exercises designed to help readers assess their own level of risk aversion. The book concludes with a thought-provoking chapter on approaching risk responsibly that will be as helpful to people well along in their careers as it will be for those who are just starting out. For me, it was a welcome reminder of what I have learned over the years. <br><br>- Karsten Ward",
