        "text": "<h3>MEMO</h3>To: New Products Department<br>From: Arianna Lee, Focus Group Coordinator<br>Date: October 12<br>Subject: Focus group number 4829<br><br>On October 10,1 conducted a formal taste test of the four new bottled iced tea drinks developed as summer specials. The flavors tested were Summer Raspberry, Fresh Mint, Fresh Mint with Lemon, and Hint of Peach. Several of you have been asking about the taste test, so I'd like to provide a brief summary.<br><br>Two groups with twelve participants each from the local area were selected at random. They met during the day of October 10 at an off-site location. Participants in the first group were given a sample of each flavor and asked to rate each sample on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 signifying that the drink was not enjoyable at all and 10 signifying that the drink was highly enjoyable. Participants in the second group were given the same samples, but the samples were labeled by name. They were then asked to rate the samples on two scales from 1 to 10: how much they enjoyed the drink and how well it satisfied the expectation created by its name. The purpose of this test was to determine if the flavors of the drinks actually match the expectation created by the name of the product.<br><br>Results of the group taste test are being processed and analyzed and will be available next week. As always, the results are confidential, so my assistant will hand deliver a paper copy of the report directly to your offices rather than sending it as an e-mail attachment. Remember, our competition is eager to find out the results. If you think you need to share any details with anyone outside our department, please check with me first.",

        "text": "<b><p align=\"center\"> Rice Crop Expected to Reach Near-Record Levels</p></b><br>The National Department of Agriculture has reported that the nation’s farms are on pace to produce their second-largest annual rice crop and fourth - largest annual soybean crop ever. As a result, grain, prices are expected to drop across the nation over the next several months, according to the government’s economic advisory office.<br><br>The forecast is based on actual field visits and fanner surveys conducted by the department. Because of higher-than-average rainfall during the early summer planting season, previous estimates had been much lower than normal. But cooler, ideal weather since then has helped many of the nation’s farmers recover from June’s heavy rains. The department forecasts that farmers will harvest 4.3 billion bushels of rice, up more than. 670 million bushels from last month’s estimate of 3.6 billion. The new estimate is only 3 percent lower than last year’s record crop of 4.5 billion bushels.<br><br>That recovery is expected to lead to lower prices for rice and soybeans, two of the nation’s most important agricultural exports. That may provide some relief to meat producers who use rice and soybeans for feed, as well as for regular citizens who had expected to pay higher prices for rice and rice products at the supermarket. The department has lowered its estimate for soybeans slightly, to 2.97 billion bushels from 3 billion last month.<br><br>The new estimate is welcome news for many other businesses as well. High rice prices had cut deeply into profits for restaurant chains, for instance, since they spend a significant portion of their budget on rice and rice products.",

        "text": "This month, we take a look at Purity Air’s Z320 100- centimeter Industrial Floor Fan. Our product reviewers found that the Z320 does a good job of eliminating stale air in machine shops, garages, factories, and construction areas. The unit is substantial, and at 28 kilograms, it is certainly not easy to lift. However, its steel frame does make it solid and durable for industrial use. The motor is completely enclosed, which allows the fan to run more quietly than many comparable products. <br> <br> Our reviewers did, however, notice some things that could be improved. While the Z32Q’s HP motor and tapered aluminum blades allow for strong airflow, its three-speed setting is problematic. The three speeds are too similar; all of them make the unit seem like it is running on a high speed. Secondly, it comes with wall-mounting brackets, but our reviewers felt that a larger bracket with stronger anchors was needed to mount a unit of such weight properly and safely. Finally, the one- year warranty covers only a select number of replacement parts, whereas similar fans manufactured by other companies include a more comprehensive warranty. This is an important issue that may well cost Purity Air some sales.",
