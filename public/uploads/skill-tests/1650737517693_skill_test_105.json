But, because of the deadline, we&rsquo;ll probably have to work a lot of overtime to finish up the work by January first.<br /> W: <strong>Q3&nbsp;You should be happy to get the contract.</strong> Lots of companies around here have had to lay off employees recently because they don&rsquo;t have enough work for them to do.</p>"
