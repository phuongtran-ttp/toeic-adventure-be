The Service was a big time-saver because my order was ready for me when I got to the store. Since I had already paid Online, I didn&rsquo;t have to wait in the regular line in the store.<br />\r\nUnfortunately, I didn&rsquo;t double-check my order before I left the store. When I arrived at the house I was working on, I realized I had received only one of the two gallons of BN-101 paint ĩ had ordered. I called the store immediately, and the manager arranged for me to pick up the missing gallon of paint at the location closest to where I was working. Also, he gave me my money back for both gallons. I will definitely use this Service again!<br />\r\nJesse Beeby<br />\r\n===============================<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo: Jesse Beeby - jbeeby@jbeebyinc.com <br />\r\nFrom: Hattie Jones- hattie.jones@brightnowhome.com <br />\r\nDate: September 19<br />\r\nSubject: Online Order<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr. Beeby, We are glad to have served your business recently.
