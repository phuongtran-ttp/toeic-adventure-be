Industry competitors responded with surprise at the news. -[l]-. And Long Ride motorcycle fans went online en masse to express frustration with Chien Motors for canceling March's much-anticipated roll- out. <br>It seems the decision to equip the Flash JX with a hybrid system, which uses both gasoline and electric power, is to blame. Chien Motors admits that the prototype was rejected because of its excessive size and weight. This design of the power system would have required a larger motorcycle body than planned. They also had concerns over its lack of power output.-[2]- . <br>In addition to the design challenges, the Long Ride factory, having been equipped to produce previous models, is not ready for production of the Flash JX hybrid -[3]- . New equipment will need to be purchased, and the assembly floor will need to be reconfigured. <br>Last year, Chien Motors was widely praised by motorcycle enthusiasts after it stepped in to save Long Ride form going out of business.

The final tour leaves at 4 P.M, except for the summer months of December through March, when this is extended to 6 P.M. Call 08 9776 5992 to make reservations. The official tour includes a brief visit to the island itself, where you can view bird-nesting areas with a PNPA park ranger as your authorized escort. <br><br><b>Payment and Reservations</b><br>• Tours are capped at 18 participants. If your group is smaller than 15, we reserve the right to include other visitors in your tour, <br>• Tickets are $20 per person for those 12 years of age and over and $10 per child under the age of 12. <br>• A nonrefundable deposit of $5 per person is required to hold a reservation for groups.

This free software gives customers the freedom to go beyond the standard templates and modify the appearance of their ticket. <br><br><b>Step 2: Choose a quantity</b><br>With Ticket Stack, you can order as few as 50 ticket or as more as you need.

We recently ordered 2,500 tickets from Ticket Stack. We decided against securing the tickets with the invisible verification stamp but did download the free software so that we would have more flexibility with the design and could include the theater’s logo. The tickets came out great! A number of patrons complimented us on the new design, and we were especially pleased with the prompt delivery! By contrast, last year we ordered tickets from a small company based here in Albany and were disappointed with the service. That order took four  weeks to arrive. This year, even though Ticket Stack is based on the opposite side of the country, we received our tickets within just five business days! <br>- Ned Collier",

Since his review will be published in the city newspaper, let’s be sure that our selections reflect the very best of The Plum Room. To get input on the menu we’ll be serving him, I’ve decided we should hold a special menu-tasting event on Saturday of next week. <br>I have a few suggestions for what we could serve at the menu tasting. How about preparing a hearty meatless entree that can really hold its own? That way we can highlight our vegetarian-friendly offerings. Perhaps our steamed shellfish dish would be a good option too. I do insist, however, on offering the new specialty pizzas we’re planning to introduce on our regular menu. That is, of course, assuming construction on the brick oven is completed by then. Also, I think we could serve at least one of our fruit desserts—they are always popular. But do know that I have full confidence in you, as Head Chef, to finalize the menu selections. <br>Lastly, I’d like to offer our menu-tasting patrons a chance to tour the kitchen while they are here. Let me know how you feel about this and how best to arrange it. <br><br>Thanks, <br>Jethro Li<br><br>----------------------------------------------<br><br><table align =\"center\"  border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0  style=border-collapse:collapse > <tr>  <td><h3 align =\"center\"> The Plum Room Tasting Menu</h3><p align =\"center\"> <b> Saturday, October 1</b></p><br>Smoked salmon canapes <br>Baked halibut in butter sauce <br>Eggplant steak with lemon tomato sauce <br>Steamed mussels and shrimp in a coconut broth <br>Roasted Tuscan chicken with white beans and wilted <br>Peach cake with glazed almonds</td></tr></table><br><br>-----------------------------------------------<br><br><h3 align =\"center\"> Tasting Comment Card</h3><b>Name:</b> <i> Elianne Aude</i> <br><b> Please comment on your tasting experience at The Plum Room.</b><br>I was pleasantly surprised by the sweetness of the eggplant dish, the sauce was a little acidic for my taste though.

Mr. Tatsuo Nomura has agreed to participate in our Speaker Series this spring. As part of your student internship responsibilities you will need to arrange his lodging here at the university for March 25-27 and have the necessary paperwork completed and approved so (hat Mr. Nomura can receive his honorarium. Please reserve a room for his presentation as well. I recommend McAneny Auditorium since it can accommodate the most people, but any of the presentation rooms in the business building would be fine. <br>Also, once Mr. Nomura provides his abstract, you will need to design a flyer and post it in the usual locations throughout the building.
