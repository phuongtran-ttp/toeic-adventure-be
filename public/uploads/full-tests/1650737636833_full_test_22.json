We'll need people to run it and sell our fresh products around town. Although these are seasonal positions, we always have openings for year-round work. If you're interested, 73just e-mail Anya, and she'll give you a listing of all our available twelve-month positions."

I'm San jay, the executive director of Human Resources, and 90today we'll be talking about selecting job applicants. As managers, it can be quite overwhelming for us to go through a large number of job applications to figure out who to interview. So to start off, 91I'd like you to turn to the person sitting next to you and take about five minutes to list both positive and negative aspects of a resume and cover letter—what stands out to you as a potential candidate to contact."

Based on our company-wide survey, 98employees disliked our initial proposal of building another office building on our campus. They thought the walk to the new building would be too far for meetings. So, instead, we’re planning on adding a new wing to an existing building. Here's our current site map, \"The architect recommends that we connect the new wing to the hall on the north side of the map, next to the pond. The new wing will have a patio area near the pond for employees to eat lunch. 100 l'd like to go over the budget for this project—it's less expensive than the previous plan."

The surveys were sent out a month ago, and I’m happy to report that 60 percent of them have already been completed and returned to us! Now, this is an incredibly high number—91 I’m sure this is because we promised to wash their car for free if they turned in a completed survey.

Open interviews will be conducted at the event.<br>Downing Way’s newest location will be the only restaurant in Sheldon that harvests its own vegetables and herbs in a garden on the premises. It also specializes in regional cuisine. “We are pleased to be able to contribute to growing the local job base,” said Marie Fontaine, founder and CEO of Downing Way. “We are looking to hire team members with a passion for food and first-class hospitality skills. We offer our staff a competitive pay rate and excellent benefits.” Interested candidates who are unable to attend the career fair may instead apply online at downingway-sheldon.com.",

The data are in and they look good. Most people expressed satisfaction with their communication with our representatives. Their questions about packaging services, shipping charges, and the status of their parcels were answered professionally and promptly.<br>One area that we need to address is the low number of referrals. Few customers we approached reported telling others about our services. Based on the answers, most people are repeat customers  who always rely on us  for their shipping needs, or they choose us based on our advertising.  Clearly, we fail to request referrals properly.<br>Therefore, our meeting next Friday will center around  this  topic.  I  will  design materials and practice activities to correct this shortcoming.  But  I would also appreciate it if you could come up with some creative ways to improve our referral rate. Send me your suggestions and I will be sure to include them in our discussion.

But while working one summer’ at a small clothing boutique, she discovered a love for retail. — [1] —. To pursue her new dream, she earned a business degree instead and opened a small store in her hometown of Edinburgh called Say Yes To Yolanda.<br>Fast-forward to today, and Ms. Abascal’s small store has expanded to a successful enterprise that earns millions of pounds each year. — [2] —. This success is in part due to the magic of Vihaan Kulkarni, whom Ms. Abascal hired four years ago to develop a parallel virtual store, YesYolanda.com. It was Mr. Kulkarni’s idea to rename the flagship store Yes Yolanda to match its digital identity.<br> Ms. Abascal is a strong proponent of  personal interaction, and she loves engaging with her customers. — [3] —. However, she realizes that an online presence is important. Yes Yolanda expects earnings from online sales alone to rise to more than £140 million this year. Nearly two-thirds of these sales will come from outside Scotland, mainly the United States, Singapore, and Australia.<br>Yes Yolanda’s workforce has expanded accordingly. Besides hiring people with technical skills to update and run the Web site, the company has just added an in-house photography studio.<br><br>“The studio ensures that items are photographed in a timely fashion for online display,” said Ms. Abascal. “This is a necessity, since new products are added every week.” — [4] —.<br>Although Ms. Abascal says she does not know what the future holds, it would seem that the only direction for Yes Yolanda is up.",

Yesterday, however, we had several interruptions in service during an important training session. In the middle of our meeting, the screen suddenly went black and a notice appeared stating, “Quipwerx is down for maintenance.” Several employees were calling in from overseas, and after this notice appeared multiple times, we decided to reschedule. Is there a way for you to inform us of your maintenance schedule in advance? If not, I will probably terminate my membership. I must be confident that I can use your product anytime I need it.<br>======================<br>To: Agnes Kowalski - akowalski@alexsycorp.net <br>From: Quipwerx Support - support@quipwerxsoftware.com <br>Date: July 29<br>Subject: Ticket: 000125659 –Web Conferencing Issues<br>Dear Ms. Kowalski,<br>Thank you for contacting us with your concerns. The issue you had this past Wednesday was caused by servers that crashed due to a database communication issue. We could not anticipate this problem, so we were unable to warn customers in advance. I assure you that this type of occurrence is very rare.<br>In light of your comments, we have decided to reword our alert message from “down for maintenance” to “experiencing technical difficulties.” That way customers will know the problem is due to unforeseen circumstances rather than routine maintenance. As a matter of fact, our software is hardly ever down for maintenance. When we work on an upgrade, the software is unavailable for just a few minutes, if at all.<br>We regret the inconvenience this has caused you and are truly grateful for your feedback. In appreciation of your business, we will be waiving the service fee on your company account for this month.<br>Sincerely,<br>Cindy Trautman, <br>Quipwerx Support",

It will be closing permanently when I retire next month. I have many pieces of furniture in excellent condition—beds, desks, easy chairs, and more. A friend suggested that this inventory could be donated to your organization. The New Start Home branch in Hartford seems to be the closest  to my  inn,  and  I see that you  are the store manager  there. We are located  almost  35 miles away.  Can I arrange a pickup of these goods at my establishment?<br>Regards,<br> Brenda Morris<br>Morris Country Inn<br>============================<br><b> Morris Country  Inn Shutting Its Doors</b><br>CANTON (April 27)—Brenda Morris watched the New Start Home truck drive away, full of furnishings from the Morris Country Inn. She has been the owner-operator of the inn, a local landmark, for 40 years. “I am happy to be heading to Seaview Point, with its beaches and warm weather,” remarked Ms. Morris. “And I now plan to spend time volunteering and just relaxing. But the inn has been a big part of my life, and it will be hard leaving this community.”<br>The property that the Morris Country Inn currently stands on has been sold to the Brent Valley Development Group, which plans to convert the building into apartment units over the coming year.",
