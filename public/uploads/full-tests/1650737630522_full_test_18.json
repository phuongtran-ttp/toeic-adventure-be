One area where we can realize savings is in printing and copying documents.<br />\r\nMany of us have been making color copies of basic documents, such as meeting minutes, product documentation drafts, and budget sheets. -[l]-, While multicolor documents are more attractive and attention-grabbing than black-and-white ones, color ink cartridges are very expensive. Purchasing frequent replacements ultimately leaves us with less money to spend on things like business travel and social events. -[2]-<br />\r\nRather than instituting a system wherein all jobs must first be approved by the department supervisors, I would prefer that employees make their own decisions about printing and copying. -[3]-. Please reserve the use of color for only those cases where visual appeal is a relevant factor. -[4]-. Thank you for your attention to this matter.",

The Expo will take place at the Sao Paulo Event Center from June 3 to June 5. More than 2,000 small-business entrepreneurs will attend workshops and showcase their businesses at booths, where visitors can collect information and ask questions. <br><br>According to an SPSBE press release, Mr. Azevedo will highlight many of the ideas from his best-selling book Keys to Startup Success, published just last year. Mr. Azevedo believes that there are several  key decisions that must be made before launching into any new business scheme. “You can’t go into it with the idea of creating a product you want to sell”，Mr. Azevedo writes in his book. “You have to create a product people want to buy. This is rule number one. And it is absolutely essential to get this right if you want your business to succeed.’’ <br><br>Mr. Azevedo is the owner of several successful businesses in Los Angeles, where he has lived for the past ten years. “I’m originally from Sao Paulo,” Mr. Azevedo said. “So I wanted to help the community where I got my start in any way I could, which is why I accepted the invitation to participate in the Expo. There’s an outstanding opportunity there for small- business owners. Following these simple but important guidelines has worked well for me and for many other successful small- business owners,” <br><br> Tickets to the Expo are RSI00. They can be purchased through the Expo’s Web site at www.saopauloexpo.com/br.",

I plan to rent a 4-door vehicle, because I will be traveling with three colleagues and want to be mindful of their comfort At the same time, I am on a limited budget, so I intend to book the least expensive vehicle of this type.<br />\r\nBefore finalizing the booking, though, there are two pieces of information I would like to have, both of which 1 was unable to locate on your site. First, if I pick up the car at your branch m San Juan and drop it off at either your Ponce or Aguadilla branch at the end of the rental period, will I be charged a drop-off fee? Second, I am unfamiliar with the roads and the traffic on the island, so I would like to add navigation system to my order. Would that be possible? If so, how much would the weekly rate be?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThank you for your assistance.<br />\r\nMagdalena Gutierrez",
