Just so everybody is clear, the common areas include the kitchen, the foyer, recreation room A, and lounge c on the second floor. I don’t know who is responsible for this recent run of uncleanliness, but from now on we are going to assign a staff member to monitor the condition of each area and sign off on it at the end of every day. We will do this until I feel everyone has learned to respect the space. Be sure to check the schedule to see which area you will be responsible for."

Therefore, I am urging all of our employees to take part in the upcoming community park cleanup sponsored by the city of Harrisburg. Without the dedication of volunteers, our parks and public spaces would not be free of litter. Donate some of your free time to keeping Harrisburg a beautiful and inviting city. <br> The community park cleanup will be held next Friday, February 18, from 1:00 to 5:00 P.M. Employees who wish to participate will leave work at lunchtime, yet will still be paid as if they had worked a full day. Volunteers are asked to bring supplies such as protective outerwear, tools, insect repellent, trash bags, and snacks. <br> A shuttle bus will depart from the company parking lot at 1:20 P.M. on Friday to take volunteers to the volunteer location. If you have a specific preference concerning the type of work you would like to do, please contact Event Organizer Don Lewis at 435- 555-6768. <br> We appreciate everyone’s enthusiasm and support. <br>Fred Hanes<br> Human Resources, Joint Systems",

I know of no other non-profit organization that performs such a vital service for all-natural agriculture as yours does, and I am enthusiastic about the prospect of the Crocket Center working with Integral Harvest. <br><br>As you know, the Crockett Center has recently turned its attention to urban gardening. On this front, the main priorities are to expand existing community gardens in Austin and to found new ones in neighborhoods currently lacking them. Therefore, I would like to proceed with the gardening classes we discussed in our meeting, to be taught on-site by Integral Harvest representatives and attended by Austin community residents. If you will let me know your representatives' availability for teaching the classes and also the range of topics they will cover, I can prepare a class schedule and generate interest in it among residents. My assistant, Cindy Reed, will call you shortly for this information. <br><br>As for your proposal that Integral Harvest representatives demonstrate organic gardening to elementary school students here in Austin, since our meeting I have spoken with several school administrators. It seems that a number of the schools have gardening clubs, so students and teachers alike should make a receptive audience. Let us discuss this proposal further in our next meeting, which Ms. Reed will schedule. <br><br>I am sure that, if our two organizations work together, we can do much to promote urban gardening as a rewarding and healthful endeavor. <br><br>Yours sincerely, <br><br>Letitia Price, Executive Director<br>Crockett Center for Community Development",

Because we went over budget last year on employee appreciation events, I think it would be wise to find more affordable recreational activities. Attached is a breakdown of projected expenses for summer events that I have planned.<br />\r\nJuly 6: Anchorage Flower Festival<br />\r\nJuly 22: Art in the Park at Lawrence Park<br />\r\nAugust 6: Bicycle Tours of the Anchorage Countryside<br />\r\nAugust 19: Horseback Riding at Sweet Meadow Ranch<br />\r\nI have scheduled fewer outdoor activities this year compared to last year. This year I would like to take advantage of a new outdoor recreational opportunity that I read about on the Anchorage Reporter website. You can read the article by clicking on this link:<br />\r\nwww.anchoragereporter.com/new_trails.<br />\r\nPlease let me know your opinion,<br />\r\nSuzie Mason<br />\r\nHuman Resources Manager<br />\r\n<br />\r\n===========================<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3 align=\"center\">Anchorage Reporter</h3>\r\n\r\n<h4 align=\"center\">Bike Tours of the Anchorage Countryside to Start August 6</h4>\r\n<br />\r\nMay 2&mdash;The Anchorage Bike Club will be hosting an annual bike riding event this summer, beginning on August 6 and running through August 7. The event will start at 10:00 A.M. on both days at the Anchorage Community Center. If you are driving a vehicle to the starting point, it would be better to use the parking lot behind the community center.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnchorage Bike Club President Jean Frost stated, &ldquo;The rides will range from 5 to 20 miles and will take bikers through scenic areas in Anchorage. Overall, the bike tours will go ahead at a leisurely pace so that bikers of all skill levels can participate. However, local bikers with ample experience might lead a faster-paced group.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBikers in the tours will learn about riding techniques, bicycle maintenance, and proper nutrition half an hour before the event starts. All participants must have biking helmets on. They are also encouraged to bring their own water to prevent dehydration while biking.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n==========================<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3 align=\"center\">BICYCLE TOUR SIGN-UP SHEET</h3>\r\n<br />\r\nIf you intend to participate in the August 6 bicycle tour, please write down your name, department, and level of experience or fitness. If we have enough people sign up as advanced, we can coordinate two separate tours. If there are not enough for two tours, we would like to encourage all riders to stay together so that everyone can join in the team building exercises we have planned.

Your monthly membership fees help US to obtain new books, computers, journal subscriptions, and other resources that are useful to the entire community. We would like to inform you of some special upcoming events this month you may be interested in attending.<br />\r\nFirst, famous children&#39;s book author and storyteller Ebert Butler will be visiting our library. He will be reading from his new book, The Mysterious Cat, and signing autographs. His book was recently nominated for the Children&#39;s Book of the Year Award. Kathy Butler, Mr. Butler&#39;s wife, will also be in attendance at this event. She has drawn the pictures in most of Mr. Butler&#39;s books, including The Mysterious Cat. This event costs $10 but is provided free for library members.<br />\r\nLater in the month, renowned wildlife photographer Nina Brooks will be holding an exhibition on the main floor of the library. Ms. Brooks recently returned from a trip to Kenya, where she photographed cheetahs, giraffes, elephants, and other animals. Her photographs capture the vividness of the wildlife and the majesty of nature.<br />\r\nIn addition to these two featured events, there will be a variety of workshops, games nights, and other events this month. Check the attached calendar for details. All events, including Movie Night, are free unless noted otherwise.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSincerely,<br />\r\nHolly Allen<br />\r\nLibrary Events Coordinator<br />\r\n<br />\r\n==============================<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Clayton Library Events Calendar<br />\r\nAugust</strong><br />\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse\">\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td><b>Date/Time </b></td>\r\n\t\t\t<td><b>Event Title</b></td>\r\n\t\t\t<td><b>Notes </b></td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Saturday, Aug. 2, 5:00 P.M.</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Creative Writers Workshop</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Led by Donna Ward</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Friday, Aug. 8, 7:00 P.M.</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Movie Night</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Family-friendly event Entrance</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Sunday, Aug. 17, 6:00 PM.</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>The Mysterious Cat Reading</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Entrance cost of $10</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Wednesday, Aug. 20, 3:00 P.M.</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Knitting Club</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Complimentary refreshments</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Saturday, Aug. 30, 2:00 P.M.</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Photo Exhibition Opening</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Entrance cost of $5</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n==============================<br />\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Clayton Library Community Chat Board</b></div>\r\n<br />\r\n<em><strong>August 1<br />\r\n&gt; User ID: Jjohnson231</strong></em><br />\r\nSubject: Creative Writers Workshop August 2<br />\r\nHey, is anybody going to go to the writers workshop tomorrow?

The grant will be used to fund the construction of a large playground that will provide recreational activities for children under 12. Since the opening of the new electronics factory last year, the number of families in the area has risen dramatically. As a result, children have been left with less and less space to play in. The new playground will allow children to play and enjoy themselves when they are not at school. <br><br>Cranton is proud to be the recipient of this grant and plans to apply for more grants in the future to improve the living conditions of the town and attract more residents",
