So it looks like we won't be able to start on the advertising campaign as originally planned. They won't be running the ads until next year. Since this will affect our schedule for the coming months, 73here's a revised timeline. Take a moment and check the dates for any potential conflicts with your new assignments."

As you know, this meeting is a great opportunity for US to assess our operating plan and to make any adjustments that might help US keep up with constant changes in the marketplace. As an advertising agency, it’s crucial we stay informed about the newest market trends. Therefore, I was excited when I heard that Tsuyoshi Ito, manager of our Japanese branch, would be visiting this Friday. In order to take advantage of his expertise and knowledge, I would like to change the meeting date so that Mr. Ito can attend. <br><br>This will be Mr. Ito’s first time in the country, so I would like you to pick him up from the airport. A company car will be provided to you for this purpose. I will e-mail again once I have more details concerning Mr. Ito’s arrival time. <br><br>Sincerely, <br><br>Sam Miller<br>President<br>Miller Advertising",

The 88-year-old company has been Denmark's leading skincare brand and the top selling cream, Xtreme 7, has been Europe's most popular facial cream for over 10 years. Though Americans may not have had access to these creams before, the brand is already generating much excitement. Dermatologist Dr. Francis Keenan explains, \"Tests have shown that Xtreme 7 dramatically reduces the fine lines around the eye area and laugh lines after only 30 days of use, but the price of the cream is only a fraction of what department store brands sell for. I'll definitely recommend this cream to my clients.\" <br>\"People have been asking about Xtreme 7 but the products haven't even arrived yet!\" added Susan Chan, an employee at a beauty counter. \"People are already calling in to pre-order.\" <br>A spokesperson for the company explained that Brand-X is making moves to expand into the North American and Asian markets. For now, only the best-selling line will be available sometime next month, outside of Europe, but within a year, more products will be available<br><br>==========================<br><br><h4 align =\"center\"> Brand-X Positions at American Headquarters in Westminster, California</h4>Don’t miss your chance to work in an exciting career in skincare and beauty with Brand-X. 80 administrative and customer service positions will be available regardless of experience. Applicants need to have good communication skills, bilingual ability in both English and Spanish is preferred but not necessary, and knowledge in computer use is a must. Applicants with experience in cosmetics, dermatology, or marketing will get a chance to work in several management positions for Brand-X. Please visit our website at www.brandx.com/jobs for more information. You can fill out the application forms and send them in before March 20th. Interviews will take place at Hillway Building on 143 Garden Road. Be sure to bring your resumes and reference letters. <br><br>===========================<br><br>To: Professor David Mills<br>From: Jacqueline O’Hare<br>Date: March 28<br>Subject:  Job<br><br>Dear Professor Mills, <br>Thank you so much for the reference letter you supplied me with. I was recently hired by Brand-X and I begin my orientations next week Wednesday at 10:00 A.M. However, we have our statistics test at that time. Is there any way that I can take a make-up test at a different time or hand in another assignment as a replacement for the test? I would hate to miss the orientations which are mandatory and I don't want to disappoint my new employers. The job should not have any other impact on my school work otherwise. I kindly appreciate your consideration in this. <br>Sincerely, <br>Jacqueline O’Hare",

Kimberly Lee, host of the My Home Cooking television show and owner of her own restaurant chain, seems to know all the secrets. Her show has been on the air for over two years, and now she has a devoted group of followers around the country. When she sat down for an interview with US, she said that fresh vegetables and local produce are the key to cooking healthy and tasty food. <br>Ms. Lee is scheduled to publish her very first cookbook near the end of the month. The book is entitled Kimberly Lee’s My Home Cooking, and it provides easy-to- follow recipes that can be made in less than 30 minutes. Over 40,000 copies have already been pre-ordered so far. <br>Ms. Lee says that the final page of the book will include a detachable fan club membership form. Those who fill the form out and send it in to the provided address will receive a monthly newsletter and exclusive recipes available only to those in the fan club. Fan club members will also receive a password that allows access to a fan club website. <br><br>===========================<br><br>To: Kimberly Lee-kimberlylee@kimberlylee.com<br>From: Suzie Sanders - suziesanders@kimberlylee.com<br>Date: October 12<br>Subject: Update<br><br>Dear Ms. Lee, <br>Great news! I’m happy to report that not only has your book been selling well, but the number of new members joining the fan club has been increasing drastically since it was published. I’m certain that the article in the newspaper helped generate considerable publicity for your book. <br>Also, we have received a lot of feedback from new members expressing a desire for more recipes for cakes, cookies, and candies to be featured in next month’s newsletter. I think it would be a good idea to meet their needs this time. <br>Sincerely, <br><br>Suzie Sanders Publicity <br>Coordinator",

I know this was an area of stress for you in the fourth quarter of last year, so I wanted to give you plenty of advanced warning. You will need to bring your numbers up significantly if you want to pass the review. As you know, we have been struggling to make our sales goals over the past several years, and I am afraid Mr. Jones is determined to trim the staff if things don&#39;t change. I have far exceeded my target numbers, so I have included an attachment with some possible leads for sales.

I will get on them right away. I don&#39;t know why my sales are slumping so much lately in the technologies division. It seems like every sales technique 1 learned in school isn&#39;t working anymore. I am thinking about changing industries if I don&#39;t pass our review when it comes out in March. My sister is opening a beauty parlor and she was asking me to become a barber. Imagine that! Anyway, thank you again for the notice about the possible layoffs coming up. I will try to get my numbers up to standards, but I think that Mr. Jones may have already decided to let me go.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAll the best,<br />\r\nAaron<br />\r\n<br />\r\n===========================<br />\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Possible Sales Leads for January</strong></div>\r\n\r\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse\" >\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr bgcolor=\"lavender\">\r\n\t\t\t<td align=\"center\"><b>Name </b></td>\r\n\t\t\t<td align=\"center\"><b>Division </b></td>\r\n\t\t\t<td align=\"center\"><b>Account Potential </b></td>\r\n\t\t\t<td align=\"center\"><b>Rating </b></td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td align=\"center\">Sally Jones</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Technologies</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td align=\"center\">$35,000-$50,000</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td align=\"center\">Silver</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td align=\"center\">Bod Knuddle</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Technologies</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td align=\"center\">$100,000 and up</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td align=\"center\">Gold</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td align=\"center\">Marquise Lee</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Technologies</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td align=\"center\">$12,000-$20,000</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td align=\"center\">Bronze/Silver</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</adonald@acemail.com></holtrain@zipnet.net></holtrain@zipnet.net></adonald@acemail.com>",
