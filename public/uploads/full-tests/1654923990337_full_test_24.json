Could you tell me about what you did? <br>M-Au: Certainly. Many factory employees are told to never stop production line – no matter what. 66 Recently I took the opposite approach. Whenever we found a defect, anyone could stop the assembly line and address the problem immediately. <br>W-Br: 66 And this transition improved your quality control? <br>M-Au: Exactly. In fact, look at this production chart. You’ll see that, 67 compared to the other factories, cars from this one have far fewer defects. <br>"

Therefore, I am urging all of our employees to take part in the upcoming community park cleanup sponsored by the city of Harrisburg.

Employees who wish to participate will leave work at lunchtime, yet will still be paid as if they had worked a full day. Volunteers are asked to bring supplies such as protective outerwear, tools, insect repellent, trash bags, and snacks. <br> A shuttle bus will depart from the company parking lot at 1:20 P.M. on Friday to take volunteers to the volunteer location. If you have a specific preference concerning the type of work you would like to do, please contact Event Organizer Don Lewis at 435- 555-6768. <br> We appreciate everyone’s enthusiasm and support. <br>Fred Hanes<br> Human Resources, Joint Systems",

For her first assignment, she has researched the challenges currently faced by our country's textile industry from an international perspective. her initial article on this topic appears in this issue. <br>The addition of internships is just one more way we fulfill our educational mission. For the past year a half, the Karimum Post has been sustained primarily by funding from local academic institutions. The paper is now focused not only on keeping the local community informed but also on serving career-development purposes. <br>A bonus of this new direction for the paper is the number of students who now contribute to the publication in multiple ways. The editor would like to take this opportunity to thank the many students who volunteer their time each month - including those who deliver the print version of the newspaper to the doorsteps of our subscribers on time every week",

The number of tourists who travel in campers, motor homes, and other recreational vehicles (RVs) has increased significantly nationwide. While the proportion of visitors who arrive by RV is still small compared to more traditional tourists, I am sure you will agree that forcing RV tourists to leave every evening only compromises our efforts to promote tourism, which is connected to a substantial amount of income for our city. We are confident that making Olsenburg “RV friendly” will benefit the local tourism industry and its employees. Three nearby cities that have lifted similar bans have reported positive results. Tocasta Town, Gamma Village, and Arcoda City are evidence that welcoming RV tourists can promote tourism, generating more reverse for restaurants and local shops. Next month, Arcoda City will even begin adding special RV parking areas in its parks.<br><br>As you know, the tourism and food service industries employ over 25 percent of our workforce. Currently, however, many of our visitors are here only during the daytime, so we are losing business to neighboring cities. RV tourism would not compete with hotel tourism. In fact, it would only increase the total number of visitors to our city.<br><br>I look forward to seeing you at the meeting next Thursday, where the city council will address this important issue.<br><br>Respectfully yours,<br>Linda Defrey<br>Senior Vice President of  overnmental Affairs<br> Olsenburg Business Association",

Ideally, we would like to have our event on Saturday, December 20. I just have a few questions about your services. First, do you provide decorations? I really want this year’s party to be a hit; it is my first time being responsible for it and I really want to impress the boss. Second do you have a wide range of vegetarian dishes? We have 12 vegetarians on our staff of 35, so it will be important to provide them a full meal, not just appetizers. If you could get back to me with the answers to my questions and your availability for the 20th, I would greatly appreciate it.<br><br>Sincerely,<br>Jason.

Let me answer all of your questions and put your mind at ease. To begin with, we have one team left that can cater you for the 20th of December, so you are in luck! As far as the decorations are concerned, we have several different themes to choose from; please visit our website at www.atasteofclass.com to see pictures of our successful events from the past. They are labeled with themes so you may just choose one that appeals to you. Your final inquiry regarding the vegetarian option will also require some decision making on your part. We offer gourmet dining and are happy to specially prepare 12 vegetarian meals, but that can be a little bit expensive. I don’t know what your budget is, but might I suggest making the entire menu vegetarian? We have an outstanding vegetarian chef, Julia Monroe, who can prepare a full vegetarian buffet so delicious a lion would eat it! This option is also a lot more cost-effective than preparing two separate menus. After reviewing your options, please let me know what choices are best for you.<br><br>Sincerely,<br>Brian Petersen,<br>Booking and Sales Manager A Taste of Class<br><br>===========================<br><br>To:Brian Petersen - bpetersen@atasteofclass.com <br>From:Jason Hostrum - jhostrum@jhfurnishing.com <br>Date:November 22<br>Subject:Office Christmas Party<br><br>Dear Mr. Petersen,<br><br>Thanks for your reply I want to go ahead and book the event for Saturday the 2Oth of December.
