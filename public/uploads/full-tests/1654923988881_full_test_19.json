Q2 Some people have camped here overnight or taken the day off work to be here. From the look of it, you’d think they were giving the shoes away</b>. The shoe is a huge upgrade on WingTip’s last pair of shoes because of their new Boost technology. The Boost technology is made with three stripes of an innovative material the company has developed, which contains thousands of specially formulated foam pellets called “energy capsules”.

Both cafes opened last month to fanfare and a great deal of press coverage. - [2] - &quot;Business has been booming,&rdquo; says Kevin Blake. &ldquo;We knew we'd be successful; we just didn&rsquo;t think we&#39;d be this successful.&rdquo; Not only are customers enthusiastically flocking to both cafes to hang out with the animals while drinking coffee and tea, many of them are adopting the animals and giving them forever homes. - [3] - &ldquo;We thought it would be a good idea to take in some of the animals because of the overcrowding in many of the shelters,&rdquo; explained Ginger Blake. &quot;And customers have a chance to interact with the animals, which is the best form of advertisement for the shelters.&rdquo; Since the cafes&rsquo; opening, more than 10 dogs and 15 cats have been adopted. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t yet own a dog, but I&rsquo;ve always wanted one,&rdquo; says Laurie Jordan, a regular customer. &ldquo;I come here to play with them. Maybe one day I&#39;ll find a dog that I really want.&rdquo; - [4] -<br /> Because of the success, the Blakes are considering expanding by purchasing the adjacent shops. &ldquo;We need more space to fit all our customers and the animals,&rdquo; explained Kevin. &ldquo;It can get very crowded at times.&rdquo; The Blakes are looking to renovate the dog caf&eacute; next month and the cat caf&eacute; during the fall</p>",

        "text": "<h4 align =\"center\"> Brand-X Coming to Town</h4>March 9 - Popular Danish skincare company Brand-X is finally launching their best-selling line in America. The 88-year-old company has been Denmark's leading skincare brand and the top selling cream, Xtreme 7, has been Europe's most popular facial cream for over 10 years. Though Americans may not have had access to these creams before, the brand is already generating much excitement. Dermatologist Dr. Francis Keenan explains, \"Tests have shown that Xtreme 7 dramatically reduces the fine lines around the eye area and laugh lines after only 30 days of use, but the price of the cream is only a fraction of what department store brands sell for. I'll definitely recommend this cream to my clients.\" <br>\"People have been asking about Xtreme 7 but the products haven't even arrived yet!\" added Susan Chan, an employee at a beauty counter. \"People are already calling in to pre-order.\" <br>A spokesperson for the company explained that Brand-X is making moves to expand into the North American and Asian markets. For now, only the best-selling line will be available sometime next month, outside of Europe, but within a year, more products will be available<br><br>==========================<br><br><h4 align =\"center\"> Brand-X Positions at American Headquarters in Westminster, California</h4>Don’t miss your chance to work in an exciting career in skincare and beauty with Brand-X. 80 administrative and customer service positions will be available regardless of experience.

I was recently hired by Brand-X and I begin my orientations next week Wednesday at 10:00 A.M. However, we have our statistics test at that time. Is there any way that I can take a make-up test at a different time or hand in another assignment as a replacement for the test? I would hate to miss the orientations which are mandatory and I don't want to disappoint my new employers. The job should not have any other impact on my school work otherwise. I kindly appreciate your consideration in this. <br>Sincerely, <br>Jacqueline O’Hare",

With over 3 million members nationwide, our franchise has become known as a reputable and trustworthy brand. Our success is a result of great relationships between US the franchiser and our franchisees.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou are receiving this mailing because you expressed interest in partnering with 24/7 Fitness in order to open a new location in your town. According to our preliminary research, your town has a large population of young, single people working in the professional field. This is our target demographic, and it means the business outlook for your 24/7 Fitness location is positive in your town. If you would like more information about the specific terms and regulations when partnering with 24/7 Fitness, please don&#39;t hesitate to call me at 347-555-3363. Additionally, if you would like to talk to another franchise owner, that information can be supplied by one of our associates.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSincerely,<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLori Swanson<br />\r\nChief Operating Officer<br />\r\n<br />\r\n==========================<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em>To: Zack Carter - zcarter@zenmail.com<br />\r\nFrom: John Morris - jmorris@cbnet.com<br />\r\nSubject: 24/7 Fitness<br />\r\nDate: March 6</em><br />\r\n<br />\r\nDear Mr. Carter,<br />\r\nMy name is John Morris and I am a small business owner living in the Millville area. I am currently in negotiations with 24/7 Fitness to open my own location here in Millville. As someone who works with 24/7 Fitness, you would help me a lot by sharing your opinions.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI am interested in how you assess 24/7 Fitness as a franchiser. I operated several franchises in the past, and I always found that trust and honesty are the most important factors in a successful relationship. More importantly, I was also wondering what kind of support is provided by the parent company. Before opening your location, did you receive adequate training to allow you to smoothly begin operating your business? Any advice you can give me would be much appreciated.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSincerely,<br />\r\nJohn Morris<br />\r\n<br />\r\n===========================<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em>To: John Morris&nbsp; - jmorris@cbnet.com<br />\r\nFrom: Zack Carter - zcarter@zenmail.com<br />\r\nSubject: 24/7 Fitness<br />\r\nDate: March 7</em><br />\r\n<br />\r\nDear Mr. Morris,<br />\r\nI am happy to provide some insight into the operation of a 24/7 Fitness franchise. I have been working with 24/7 Fitness as a franchise owner for 10 years now. I actually run three different branches now. I completely agree with you that trust and honesty are the two most important aspects of any business relationship. On that count, I believe the fact that I own three franchises is testament to my faith in the franchiser.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLet me put your mind at ease. First off, 24/7 Fitness has a very specific way that they want their brand to develop no matter who owns the branch. The parent company will not only provide training, but they insist on controlling the actual layout of the facilities from the locker rooms to the free weights. They want any of their 3 million members to be able to walk into any one of their gyms and feel at home. Until you have been operating for one full year, you must make monthly reports to corporate headquarters detailing all aspects of sales, membership, and a flow chart describing the usage of the facilities. It really is hands on until they have confidence you can represent the brand. I hope this helps you decide to join the 24/7 Fitness team!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAll the best,<br />\r\nZack Carter",

From the moment it opened, the pavilion featuring the Brazilian chocolatier Amo-Te has been overrun with enthusiastic visitors.<br />\r\n&quot;We didn&#39;t expect to be so popular,&quot; remarked company Marketing Manager Andreas Gomes, who arrived at the expo just in time to see his company&#39;s artisanal confectioners explain the chocolate-making process to eager crowds. &ldquo; We drew so many visitors that I had to fly in five more employees from our headquarters in Brazil to staff our busy display area.&rdquo;<br />\r\nVintage products that Amo-Te no longer distributes to retailers have been released in limited quantities. One exclusively available at the Expo is the once-popular bar made from dried fruit and covered with dark chocolate. The company has reproduced this old favorite in a classic, retro-style wrapper.<br />\r\n&ldquo;We were confident that our appeal to chocolate-lovers&#39; sense of nostalgia would be welcome,&rdquo; said Mr. Gomes, &ldquo;but we never expected this kind of success!&rdquo;<br />\r\n=================<br />\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://storage.googleapis.com/comaiphuong-edu-media/images/257579911-1566805003865-10.png\" /><br />\r\n=================<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://storage.googleapis.com/comaiphuong-edu-media/images/1801772-1566805018741-11.png\" /></div>",

JM Solutions would be happy to offer you our services.<br />\r\nAs I said on the phone, we will help design and program a website that will attract more customers and offer an online sales platform. During this time, we will need to hold meetings with your marketing division in order to best capture your company&rsquo;s goals. Once the website has been completed in mid-February next year, we will hold a training seminar in order to train your employees in the skills necessary to maintain and update your website. The website development and training seminar will cost a total of $32,000. We request that a deposit of 10% be paid in advance. Please see the attached file for detailed costs and schedules.<br />\r\nWe look forward to working with you in the near future. Our staff members will strive to meet all your needs.. Therefore, just let me know when your marketing division is available to meet US in person and discuss some of the details of the project. Please contact me at your convenience.<br />\r\nEric West<br />\r\n<br />\r\n===========================<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em>To:Lillian Ross -lillianross@kingstonsportinggoods.com<br />\r\nFrom:Raymond Wells -raymondwells@kingstonsportinggoods.com<br />\r\nDate:November 4, 10:37 A.M.<br />\r\nSubject:First Quarter Budget<br />\r\nAttachment: Q1_Budget</em><br />\r\n<br />\r\nDear Ms. Ross,<br />\r\nI have attached the current draft for the company&rsquo;s budget for the first quarter of next year. As you will notice, all of the profits made from this year&rsquo;s back-to-school sale are planned to be spent on billboard advertisements on the main highways. I will call a design team later this afternoon and ask them to create eye-catching images for the advertisement.<br />\r\nAt our last meeting, you mentioned that you would like to review the budget before it is finalized. I have already included employee raises in the first quarter&rsquo;s expenses, but if you can think of anything else, please let me know. I would like to have the budget finalized before next week&rsquo;s planning meeting.<br />\r\nRaymond Wells<br />\r\n<br />\r\n===========================<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em>To:Raymond Wells -raymondwells@kingstonsportinggoods.com<br />\r\nFrom:Lillian Ross -lillianross@kingstonsportinggoods.com<br />\r\nDate:November 4, 10:40 AM<br />\r\nSubject:Emergency Budget Addition</em><br />\r\n<br />\r\nDear Mr. Wells,<br />\r\nI am glad you forwarded me your proposed budget when you did. Just prior to receiving your e-mail, I received an estimate for our planned website development. It looks like it is going to be more expensive than I had anticipated. Although the final bill of $32,000 is not due immediately, we will have to find an extra $3,200 in next year&rsquo;s first quarter budget if we want to proceed with JM Solutions&rsquo; proposal.<br />\r\nIf you have any questions regarding this matter, please just come to my office and we can go over where we can make the tough cuts to come up with this funding.",
