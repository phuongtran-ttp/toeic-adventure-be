What is it? <br>M: <b> There is a major pest problem in the building, and they need to clear the whole building and carry out pest control</b>. It’s going to take them at least three months to make sure the building is clean. So you would have to wait three months to get a place there... <br>W: I see... <br>M: There is a building just nearby called Graceville Towers. It’s very close to the Kahlua building so you could stay there for three months then move over to the Kahlua building. <b> I will arrange ail of the moving for you</b>. Why don’t you go online and check out Graceville Towers and get back to me? <br>W: Sure, that sounds good. Thanks Joseph."

As the CEO of Metro Studios, it is my great pleasure to witness this amazing opportunity to work with such a high caliber company like Walker Studios. They possess a number of studios that are capable of producing cutting edge quality 3-D films. This will allow our company to begin producing 3-D films. <b>And why wouldn’t we</b>? The majority of our films are science fiction, and I believe a transition into 3-D is an excellent path for US. I have ensured that we will have full access to Walker Studio’s equipment, and in return they will become a shareholder in our company. <b> I suggest that our studio staff should spend the next following weeks studying how this new type of equipment works, so we can begin producing content as soon as possible.</b>"

In order to stay competitive, we must be able to introduce new styles of craft beer to our consumers. Our analysts agree, if the current trend continues, Strange Brew Ales will bump US out of the top five by this time next year. Our master brewers have come up with four new styles of beer that we will introduce to a focus group at the upcoming Northcut Beer Festival. <b> Once we get consumer feedback we will select the two most popular offerings and create an aggressive marketing campaign</b>. Our sales must increase by at least 5% over the next quarter in order to maintain our market share in Northcut."

We offer a two- semester training program to become a dental assistant at our community college. Tuition for a single semester is $6,500. <br>W: Oh, I see. Honestly, that is a little more than I expected. <b> I will have to ask my bank about the possibility of getting a student loan</b>. Is there anything else you can tell me? <br>M: <b> Well, one thing to keep in mind is that our community college offers night classes for all our programs</b>. This is very good for students who work during the day. And please remember that we are one of the top-ranked schools in the state, and so far more than 5,000 of our graduates have become dental assistants."

These televisions provide state-of-the-art features at moderate prices. By showing your customers that Topline Electronics offers the best deals in the area, you will be able to maintain customer loyalty. We will be shipping the new televisions to your store within the next week. We suggest you prepare a prominent display space in your store to feature them. You should also update your website to advertise the sale. <br><br>Smooth communication between you and US is vital to effective operational practices.

The most serious violation concerned the improper storage and labeling of food. All ingredients stored for later use must be labeled with an exact date and detailed contents. If we do not label containers properly, spoiled food could accidently be served to customers. We received relatively low grades for employee hygiene and the cleanliness of our facilities. All employees are required to wear their uniform and hairnet at all times and wash their hands after every bathroom visit. We also need to mop floors more often and keep them dry. <br>In order to correct these poor situations, I will be posting a checklist that all employees will be required to complete every morning. It will include necessary preparations to ensure that we are not breaking any regulations. This measure will go into effect on January 29. <br>If you have any questions about these changes, please bring them up at the staff meeting tomorrow. <br><br>===========================<br> <br><h3 align = \"center\"> NOTICE TO ALL EMPLOYEES</h3><br>The checklist below must be signed by every employee on every day that they have a shift  at Polito’s Pizza. Only sign the task once it has been completed or checked.

However, for customers who sign up for an entire year’s worth of deliveries, we will deliver your package for free. The purchase of additional items will also affect the final price of your package. Additional options are available on our website. Payments can be made via cash, credit card, check, or money order on the day of delivery. <br><br>We know that our customers especially care about the quality of the food.
