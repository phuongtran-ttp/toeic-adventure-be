Within just a couple of hours of opening the doors, most of the Bucci design items were sold out. Similar reports of chaos and empty shelves which once held items from the Bucci line were echoed in major cities around the world including New York, London, Tokyo, and Milan. - [2] - Although B&G has released limited edition collaborations with other famous designers, this is the first time that B&G shops have reported a complete depletion of items within hours of its release. The Bucci and B&G collaboration is the most successful to date and, already, talks are in progress over future collaborations for more clothing lines. - [3] - Meanwhile in Seoul, shoppers who were unable to purchase from the Bucci line were disappointed but excited to have the popular retailer open in Korea. - [4] –",

I noticed that the library recently built the Media Lab with funds raised by library patrons. I was hoping to change classrooms in order to use my new educational resources by integrating computers into my English conversation class. Could you please reschedule my class to be provided in the same classroom as Never Too Late to Learn instead of the Education Center? I think my students will appreciate the practical English skills they can learn on computers. Also, could you please send an e-mail to all of the students who have signed up for the class? They will need to be informed about the room change.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThank you in advance for your assistance,<br />\r\nLinda Carter<br />\r\n<br />\r\n===========================<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo: Richard White - rwhite@newtonlibrary.edu<br />\r\nFrom: Linda Carter - lcarter121@seprus.com<br />\r\nDate: April 2 Subject: Room Change<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDear Ms. Carter,<br />\r\nI would be happy to move your Beginners English Conversation course to the classroom with the updated media lab; for your reference, this is room 3A. Unfortunately, I do not have the emails for all of the students who signed up for your course. Many students only provided their names. I could post a sign at the entrance to the library advertising your course and make a note of the room change, if that would be acceptable for you. Please let me know if you would like me to do this.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThank you and all the best,<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRichard White<br />\r\nLibrary Projects Coordinator",

This year I would like to take advantage of a new outdoor recreational opportunity that I read about on the Anchorage Reporter website.

The event will start at 10:00 A.M. on both days at the Anchorage Community Center. If you are driving a vehicle to the starting point, it would be better to use the parking lot behind the community center.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnchorage Bike Club President Jean Frost stated, &ldquo;The rides will range from 5 to 20 miles and will take bikers through scenic areas in Anchorage. Overall, the bike tours will go ahead at a leisurely pace so that bikers of all skill levels can participate. However, local bikers with ample experience might lead a faster-paced group.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBikers in the tours will learn about riding techniques, bicycle maintenance, and proper nutrition half an hour before the event starts. All participants must have biking helmets on. They are also encouraged to bring their own water to prevent dehydration while biking.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n==========================<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3 align=\"center\">BICYCLE TOUR SIGN-UP SHEET</h3>\r\n<br />\r\nIf you intend to participate in the August 6 bicycle tour, please write down your name, department, and level of experience or fitness. If we have enough people sign up as advanced, we can coordinate two separate tours. If there are not enough for two tours, we would like to encourage all riders to stay together so that everyone can join in the team building exercises we have planned.
