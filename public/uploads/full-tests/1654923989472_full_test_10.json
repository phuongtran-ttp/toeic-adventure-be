To the untrained eye, the lighthouse appears to be in good shape. However, according to chief engineer Edward Sayer, the tower is in dire need of repair to replace loose bricks and address severe corrosion at the base of the structure. President of the Marsh Point Historical Society Glenda Lewis remarks, “For almost 200 years, the lighthouse has been an aid to navigation. Restoring the lighthouse now may extend its service for another two centuries.”<br><br>The lighthouse is also important for cultural reasons. As Stephanie Landsbury of the city tourist board notes, ‘The Marsh Point Lighthouse is a local landmark. It has been featured on posters and signs and even plays a pivotal role in the movie classic <i>A Clear Beam of Light.”</i><br><br>Restoration of the structure will be done in phases over the next eighteen months, and will include work on the interior as well as the exterior of the lighthouse. Parts of the structure will remain open to the public while the work is being done, as will the museum and gift shop also on the premises. The completion of the project is expected to coincide with the building’s bicentennial. Donations to help support the cost of the restoration are being solicited from local individuals and corporate sponsors.",

Learning about different kinds of loans will help you make an informed decision. Review the loan choices below and decide which loan is right for your situation.<br />\r\n<b><u>Fixed-Rate Mortgage Loan</u></b> - This loan ensures that your interest rate and monthly principal repayment remain the same during the entire period of your loan. This loan protects you from rising interest rates and may be a good choice if you plan to live in your home for a long time.<br />\r\n<b><u>Adjustable-Rate Mortgage Loan</u></b><u> </u> - Your interest rate remains fixed for the initial 5 years, and then is adjusted annually. Typically, this loan has a lower initial interest rate than on a fixed- rate mortgage.<br />\r\n<b><u>Interest-Only Mortgage Loan</u></b><u> </u> - During the initial 5 years of the loan, you are required to make payments on interest only. This option is suitable for those with fluctuating incomes. When your finances are tight, you can make the interest-only payment. And when your earnings increase, you can make payments on principal.<br />\r\n<b><u>Home Opportunity Loan </u></b><u> </u> -This special loan is designed for first-time home buyers. You do not need a large down payment and a perfect credit rating in order to qualify for this loan.",

JM Solutions would be happy to offer you our services.<br />\r\nAs I said on the phone, we will help design and program a website that will attract more customers and offer an online sales platform. During this time, we will need to hold meetings with your marketing division in order to best capture your company&rsquo;s goals. Once the website has been completed in mid-February next year, we will hold a training seminar in order to train your employees in the skills necessary to maintain and update your website. The website development and training seminar will cost a total of $32,000. We request that a deposit of 10% be paid in advance. Please see the attached file for detailed costs and schedules.<br />\r\nWe look forward to working with you in the near future. Our staff members will strive to meet all your needs.. Therefore, just let me know when your marketing division is available to meet US in person and discuss some of the details of the project. Please contact me at your convenience.<br />\r\nEric West<br />\r\n<br />\r\n===========================<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em>To:Lillian Ross -lillianross@kingstonsportinggoods.com<br />\r\nFrom:Raymond Wells -raymondwells@kingstonsportinggoods.com<br />\r\nDate:November 4, 10:37 A.M.<br />\r\nSubject:First Quarter Budget<br />\r\nAttachment: Q1_Budget</em><br />\r\n<br />\r\nDear Ms. Ross,<br />\r\nI have attached the current draft for the company&rsquo;s budget for the first quarter of next year. As you will notice, all of the profits made from this year&rsquo;s back-to-school sale are planned to be spent on billboard advertisements on the main highways. I will call a design team later this afternoon and ask them to create eye-catching images for the advertisement.<br />\r\nAt our last meeting, you mentioned that you would like to review the budget before it is finalized. I have already included employee raises in the first quarter&rsquo;s expenses, but if you can think of anything else, please let me know. I would like to have the budget finalized before next week&rsquo;s planning meeting.<br />\r\nRaymond Wells<br />\r\n<br />\r\n===========================<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em>To:Raymond Wells -raymondwells@kingstonsportinggoods.com<br />\r\nFrom:Lillian Ross -lillianross@kingstonsportinggoods.com<br />\r\nDate:November 4, 10:40 AM<br />\r\nSubject:Emergency Budget Addition</em><br />\r\n<br />\r\nDear Mr. Wells,<br />\r\nI am glad you forwarded me your proposed budget when you did. Just prior to receiving your e-mail, I received an estimate for our planned website development. It looks like it is going to be more expensive than I had anticipated. Although the final bill of $32,000 is not due immediately, we will have to find an extra $3,200 in next year&rsquo;s first quarter budget if we want to proceed with JM Solutions&rsquo; proposal.<br />\r\nIf you have any questions regarding this matter, please just come to my office and we can go over where we can make the tough cuts to come up with this funding.",

The hosing was listed as capable of handling up to 1,000 pounds of pressure per square inch (psi). My company, Advanced Dynamic Cleaning, refitted all of our pressure washers with your hosing at considerable cost and time. Every single one of our pressure washers failed somewhere along the hosing from the joint of the gun to the compressor. Our compressors only create 500 psi, so I have to conclude that there is some defect in the design of your hose. I would like to get a refund of my purchase or a replacement of my order with hosing that meets industry standards. I have included my purchase order and a copy of the invoice.<br><br>Sincerely,<br>Jose Ramos<br>===========================<br><br>To:Jose Ramos - jramos.zipnet.com <br>From: Raquel Jenkins- cservice@starproducts.com <br>Date:October 16<br>Subject:Defective Hose<br><br>Dear Mr. Ramos,<br><br>We have received your report of a defective hose and reviewed the attached documents. We really value your business and hate that you went through such a waste of time and energy with our hosing. However, I am afraid to say that the mistake may be on your end. In looking over your purchase, you clearly ordered XP100 hosing X 5,000 yards. If you look at the specs for that hosing, it is only rated at appropriate for 100 psi. This could explain why all of your hosing failed. What I can offer you is an exchange of the remaining XP100 hosing in your inventory for a hosing more appropriate to your needs. We will do this at no charge and pay for the shipping as a show of our appreciation for your business. Please fill out the purchase order that I have attached and include it with the XP100 hosing when you ship it back to US for exchange.<br><br>Thank you,<br>Raquel Jenkins<br>===========================<br>@PS@/onthisinhvien.appspot.com/images/6789034_1592552433067.png@PE@<br>===========================",

This service only costs $2 a month. Using your smartphone, you can access your accounts no matter where you are.

According to our account data, we see that you did contact us and freeze your accounts, though it looks like it was too late to prevent the withdrawal and subsequent overdraft of your account. It is a little bit unusual that the transaction that caused the overdraft was at an ATM machine a day after you say that you lost your card. Have you given your access pin to anybody recently? I would be happy to pass your request for overdraft relief on to our fraud department, but you will need to file a police report and then send us the case number that the investigating officer gives you. Once we receive this number, we can proceed with our review of your case.<br />\r\nThank you and good day,<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLaura Massey,<br />\r\nCustomer Service Specialist, Stark Bank /customerservice@starkbank.com / ssummers@zippynet.com / ssummers@zippynet.com / customerservice@starkbank.com",

First, we have a group of ten golfers. Now I know most courses generally limit a group to four players to keep up the pace of play, but I was really hoping you could make an exception for us and allow two groups of five. We will even rent golf carts to ensure that we don’t cause a delay. As for the $5 gift cards to the pro shop, I was wondering if they could be pooled together for one large purchase. It is my son’s birthday and I would like to buy him a new putter and they are awfully expensive these days. $50 bucks could go a long way to giving him a great gift! <br>We would like to tee off around 11:30 A.M. on Saturday, July 20th, and then have dinner there at about 6:00 P.M. Please write back to confirm our tee time and answer my queries. Thank you for your time! <br>Have a great day, <br> Logan Mankins",
