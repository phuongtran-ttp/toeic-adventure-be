Even so, last week's fashion show in Milan was particularly notable for the vast number of garments made partly or entirely out of silk. From eveningwear to sportswear, many designers featured colorful silks in their collections.<br><br>The designers were likely responding to a market trend: a dramatically increased demand for colorful silk products. “Our sales of silk shirts and dresses have reached an all-time high,” said Christina Alvarez, a buyer for Gatsby’s in London. “Silk items have been flying off the racks.”<br><br>Economic analysts were surprised by the trend, since they had predicted that the rise of dry-cleaning costs would take a toll on silk manufacturers. However, comfort may have been a greater factor than price, especially given the unusually hot weather this past summer. “Today’s silk garments,” said Ms. Alvarez, “are lighter and cooler than many other types of clothing.”",

We are proud of our long heritage and are confident you will appreciate the quality and craftsmanship that went into the making of your product. Our furniture is meant to last a lifetime. That is why we make every effort to inform our customers how best to treat it. We recommend the following. <br><br>• Use cleaning products that are made specifically for wood such as Bly’s Wood Cleaner. Avoid multisurface cleaners, as these may leave streaks or an oily residue.<br>• To brighten a surface that has dulled, use a paste wax such as Russ Wax. Apply the wax no more than twice per year. Remove the old wax first with a mild, nonalkaline soap-and-water solution.<br>• Avoid wiping the furniture with a dry cloth, as this may leave hairline scratches on the finish.<br>• Avoid placing the furniture directly in front of radiators, heating ducts, and fireplaces.<br>• Do not expose the furniture to direct sunlight, as this may lead to fading.<br><br>We wish you a lifetime of enjoyment from your furniture. We appreciate your business, and we welcome your comments and suggestions. Simply call 604-555-0144 during regular business</td></tr> </table>",
