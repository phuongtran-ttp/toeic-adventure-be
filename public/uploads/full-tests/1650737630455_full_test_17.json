The speed of social media, as well as its relative inexpensiveness, make it an attractive option for small companies that can&#39;t rely on television or magazine advertising to reach new customers. And most sites can be managed without the help of a technology expert. For reaching larger, more general audiences, &mdash; [1]&mdash; .<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But even though social media offers many opportunities, you should not try to promote your business on as many outlets as possible. Managing information on several networks can quickly become a full-time job and can make it harder, not easier, to control your message. &mdash; [2]&mdash;. Therefore, it is important that you learn the benefits and limitations of each social media platform, and then decide which one or two are best suited to your target customers. &mdash; [3]&mdash; .<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Different platforms focus on different kinds of content, like photos, videos, short messages, or blogs. Some platforms need to be updated frequently, with customers expecting you to post new material every day. &mdash; [4]&mdash;. Certain platforms are better for reaching larger, more general audiences, while some allow you to focus on a specific group of customers. So before you set up accounts on every available platform, think about your business needs and your customer base.</div>",

This is beyond the skills of most small-business owners.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Francine Malloy couldn&#39;t agree more. &ldquo; I looked into purchasing Reserva after one of our guests recommended it. I was so relieved to finally find a solution to our Web site problems. The Reserva software is very easy to use and intuitive. Even more, with the help of the tools provided, we were able to update the site information ourselves. Our guests, and particularly our return guests, are very impressed with our new Web site. All parties involved are very satisfied.

The much loved <em>Waking Up</em> chronicled the ups and downs Mendoza experienced as he moved from job to job as a youth, working as everything from dock worker and fisherman, to hotel clerk and tennis<br />\r\ninstructor. <em>Life Lessons in Advertising</em> picks up where the previous book left off, with Mendoza having just arrived in New York City. We follow his rise from mailroom clerk to the head of M&amp;D Creative, a highly successful advertising agency.<br />\r\nWritten in the humorous, informal style that has made Mendoza&#39;s ads so successful over the years, the book shares stories of client case histories and reveals how he developed his most successful advertisements. The book is now available online and in bookstores everywhere.<br />\r\n<br>=================\r\n<br>Book Review: Life Lessons in Advertising\r\n<br>By Julia Turnbull\r\n<br>Given that it took twenty years for David Mendoza\td\r\nto write his second book, Life Lessons in Advertising, the impression the reader is left with at the end is that\r\nhe forgot to edit his work. While 1 thoroughly enjoyed Mendoza’s previous book, this sequel is made up of dull, complicated sentences that make reading a chore. There’s no argument regarding his abilities as an advertising executive, yet the anecdotes about life in the advertising business arc so much less engaging than those earlier stories that almost jumped off the pages. For example, nothing matches the earlier book’s crystal clear descriptions of his escapades and unexpected adventures as a hotel clerk in northern Montana. This is one book you can skip. \r\n\r\n<br>=================\r\n\r\n<i><br>Advertising in Motion Magazine\r\n<br>A minute with...\r\n<br>Advertising guru David Mendoza</i>\r\n<br><br><b>AIMM:</b>\tWhy did it take you so long to write this book?\r\n<br><b>Mendoza:</b> It's funny. I've always considered my copywriting to be my strength. But long pieces of writing, like manuscripts, are very difficult for me, so 1 take my time to edit them carefully. But I'm very proud of the end result-—it's easy to read and highly enjoyable, just like my first book.\r\n<br><b>AIMM:</b> You've held so many jobs, like fisherman and tennis instructor. Why do you think advertising stuck?\r\n<br><b>Mendoza:</b> I'm not so sure it did really stick, although I've been with it for a while. My philosophy is to be open to any opportunity that comes my way. Advertising came my way, but I'm rather sure it's not the last thing I'll try my hand at And you never know, 1 might go back to fishing or tennis.",
