        "text": "<h4>A Long-Lasting Love for Books</h4> February 29 - Both in and around Pine Hill, Alfred Carlson，who has been teaching Russian literature at Pine Hill State University for twenty years, is probably best known as the owner of The Treasure Box, the town's oldest bookstore. The store has two unique features: it specializes in rare books and is open for business on Saturdays only. Evidently, walk-in sales make up only a small percentage of Mr. Carlson’s business; the bulk of the store’s revenue is generated by orders placed over the telephone or online by universities, museums, and private collectors. <br>On Sunday The Treasure Box will be celebrating its sixtieth anniversary. “When my mother, Willisa, opened the bookstore all those years ago on Green Edge Road, two blocks from here, she probably had no idea it would still be serving the public six decades later,” Mr. Carlson said. The store still  displays the original sign over the doorway. The interior <b> retains</b> the living-room atmosphere it always had, with its mismatched tables and chairs. One section of the store is filled with books about baseball, an abiding passion of the Carlson family. On Friday nights the store becomes an informal social club. Not surprisingly, members tend to enjoy conversation about rare books, literature, and baseball. <br>Later this month Mr. Carlson will mark another milestone: he will be retiring from his teaching position. His retirement does not mean, however, that The Treasure Box will see extended business hours; it will continue to be open once a week. “I am not retiring from one job just so that I can spend more time on another,” Mr. Carlson said. “Rather, the fact that I no longer will have to prepare for classes or grade students’ papers means that I will be able to dedicate more time to my children and grandchildren.”",
