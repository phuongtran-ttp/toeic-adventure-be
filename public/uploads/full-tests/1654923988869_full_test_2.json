More and more of them are being asked to wait a week or longer for service from a repair crew.

This means that the number of technicians available to assist customers is now insuffcient.<bR><bR>The committee feels an expansion of the repair team is necessary to restore customer satisfaction. We are expecting even more customers to have our equipment installed in their homes, and with the present number of technical crews, we may not be able to handle their service needs.

It seems that a number of the schools have gardening clubs, so students and teachers alike should make a receptive audience. Let us discuss this proposal further in our next meeting, which Ms. Reed will schedule. <br><br>I am sure that, if our two organizations work together, we can do much to promote urban gardening as a rewarding and healthful endeavor. <br><br>Yours sincerely, <br><br>Letitia Price, Executive Director<br>Crockett Center for Community Development",

As I own a vegetarian restaurant, I will need to have an idea of the types of produce that will be delivered so I can prepare my menus accordingly. Thank you so much for your consideration, and I look forward to working with Bountiful Harvest! <br><br>Kind regards, <br>Emily Hall",

First, we have a group of ten golfers. Now I know most courses generally limit a group to four players to keep up the pace of play, but I was really hoping you could make an exception for us and allow two groups of five. We will even rent golf carts to ensure that we don’t cause a delay. As for the $5 gift cards to the pro shop, I was wondering if they could be pooled together for one large purchase. It is my son’s birthday and I would like to buy him a new putter and they are awfully expensive these days. $50 bucks could go a long way to giving him a great gift! <br>We would like to tee off around 11:30 A.M. on Saturday, July 20th, and then have dinner there at about 6:00 P.M. Please write back to confirm our tee time and answer my queries. Thank you for your time! <br>Have a great day, <br> Logan Mankins",

The much loved <em>Waking Up</em> chronicled the ups and downs Mendoza experienced as he moved from job to job as a youth, working as everything from dock worker and fisherman, to hotel clerk and tennis<br />\r\ninstructor. <em>Life Lessons in Advertising</em> picks up where the previous book left off, with Mendoza having just arrived in New York City. We follow his rise from mailroom clerk to the head of M&amp;D Creative, a highly successful advertising agency.<br />\r\nWritten in the humorous, informal style that has made Mendoza&#39;s ads so successful over the years, the book shares stories of client case histories and reveals how he developed his most successful advertisements. The book is now available online and in bookstores everywhere.<br />\r\n<br>=================\r\n<br>Book Review: Life Lessons in Advertising\r\n<br>By Julia Turnbull\r\n<br>Given that it took twenty years for David Mendoza\td\r\nto write his second book, Life Lessons in Advertising, the impression the reader is left with at the end is that\r\nhe forgot to edit his work. While 1 thoroughly enjoyed Mendoza’s previous book, this sequel is made up of dull, complicated sentences that make reading a chore. There’s no argument regarding his abilities as an advertising executive, yet the anecdotes about life in the advertising business arc so much less engaging than those earlier stories that almost jumped off the pages. For example, nothing matches the earlier book’s crystal clear descriptions of his escapades and unexpected adventures as a hotel clerk in northern Montana. This is one book you can skip. \r\n\r\n<br>=================\r\n\r\n<i><br>Advertising in Motion Magazine\r\n<br>A minute with...\r\n<br>Advertising guru David Mendoza</i>\r\n<br><br><b>AIMM:</b>\tWhy did it take you so long to write this book?\r\n<br><b>Mendoza:</b> It's funny. I've always considered my copywriting to be my strength. But long pieces of writing, like manuscripts, are very difficult for me, so 1 take my time to edit them carefully. But I'm very proud of the end result-—it's easy to read and highly enjoyable, just like my first book.\r\n<br><b>AIMM:</b> You've held so many jobs, like fisherman and tennis instructor. Why do you think advertising stuck?\r\n<br><b>Mendoza:</b> I'm not so sure it did really stick, although I've been with it for a while. My philosophy is to be open to any opportunity that comes my way. Advertising came my way, but I'm rather sure it's not the last thing I'll try my hand at And you never know, 1 might go back to fishing or tennis.",
