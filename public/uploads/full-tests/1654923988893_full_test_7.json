This means that our factory can now move double the number of units per hour. Clearly, this is a big improvement in production speed. However, it could also be a challenge for us to watch out for production errors. So,<b>you’re all required to watch a short training video this morning before starting work. </b>"

Beginning in November, she will be general manager of City Wheels, a bike-sharing company in Auckland. — [2]—. The move comes at an opportune moment for both Ms. Haas and City Wheels. Ms. Haas had worked for Gear Good in Wellington since the company was founded five years ago but was yearning to return to Auckland, where she grew up. City Wheels was looking for a new leader to oversee its planned expansion from 50 to 75 bike stations in Auckland. —[3] —. “I’m thrilled to join a company that’s important to residents and tourists alike,” Ms. Haas said. <br>The City Wheels system is simple and affordable for occasional use. —[4] —. The first thirty minutes of biking are free, and after that, the cost is $4 per hour or $20 per day. Ms. Haas said she is enthusiastic about this venture, both for herself and for the city of Auckland. - Tahei Davis, Staff Writer",

But while working one summer’ at a small clothing boutique, she discovered a love for retail. — [1] —. To pursue her new dream, she earned a business degree instead and opened a small store in her hometown of Edinburgh called Say Yes To Yolanda.<br>Fast-forward to today, and Ms. Abascal’s small store has expanded to a successful enterprise that earns millions of pounds each year. — [2] —. This success is in part due to the magic of Vihaan Kulkarni, whom Ms. Abascal hired four years ago to develop a parallel virtual store, YesYolanda.com. It was Mr. Kulkarni’s idea to rename the flagship store Yes Yolanda to match its digital identity.<br> Ms. Abascal is a strong proponent of  personal interaction, and she loves engaging with her customers. — [3] —. However, she realizes that an online presence is important. Yes Yolanda expects earnings from online sales alone to rise to more than £140 million this year. Nearly two-thirds of these sales will come from outside Scotland, mainly the United States, Singapore, and Australia.<br>Yes Yolanda’s workforce has expanded accordingly. Besides hiring people with technical skills to update and run the Web site, the company has just added an in-house photography studio.<br><br>“The studio ensures that items are photographed in a timely fashion for online display,” said Ms. Abascal. “This is a necessity, since new products are added every week.” — [4] —.<br>Although Ms. Abascal says she does not know what the future holds, it would seem that the only direction for Yes Yolanda is up.",

I am very excited to have been paired with you as pen pals. I hope we can learn a lot from each other and build a lasting friendship.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs you know, I live in California, which is a long way from Wisconsin. I hope that in the coming months I can find some time off work and visit you. Please let me know when the most convenient time would be for me to meet you.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI look forward to hearing from you,<br />\r\nJessica Wright<br />\r\n<br />\r\n===========================<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDear Jessica,<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou don&rsquo;t know how much I appreciate your kind words. Although the staff at Clearwater are very kind, I feel the need to connect with people who are not part of the staff. My surviving family also live a great distance away, in Florida, and so most of the time I am just communicating with the paid staff or the other patients. I would welcome a visit, if you truly wanted to come, and the best time would be for our meeting is the Thanksgiving holiday party here at the center I suppose. My own family might be here as well. If it is too much for you, or if you can&rsquo;t get the time off of work, don&rsquo;t worry about it too much. I do hope that we can continue to communicate through our letters.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAll the best,<br />\r\nMonica Greene",

Yesterday, however, we had several interruptions in service during an important training session. In the middle of our meeting, the screen suddenly went black and a notice appeared stating, “Quipwerx is down for maintenance.” Several employees were calling in from overseas, and after this notice appeared multiple times, we decided to reschedule. Is there a way for you to inform us of your maintenance schedule in advance? If not, I will probably terminate my membership. I must be confident that I can use your product anytime I need it.<br>======================<br>To: Agnes Kowalski - akowalski@alexsycorp.net <br>From: Quipwerx Support - support@quipwerxsoftware.com <br>Date: July 29<br>Subject: Ticket: 000125659 –Web Conferencing Issues<br>Dear Ms. Kowalski,<br>Thank you for contacting us with your concerns. The issue you had this past Wednesday was caused by servers that crashed due to a database communication issue. We could not anticipate this problem, so we were unable to warn customers in advance. I assure you that this type of occurrence is very rare.<br>In light of your comments, we have decided to reword our alert message from “down for maintenance” to “experiencing technical difficulties.” That way customers will know the problem is due to unforeseen circumstances rather than routine maintenance. As a matter of fact, our software is hardly ever down for maintenance. When we work on an upgrade, the software is unavailable for just a few minutes, if at all.<br>We regret the inconvenience this has caused you and are truly grateful for your feedback. In appreciation of your business, we will be waiving the service fee on your company account for this month.<br>Sincerely,<br>Cindy Trautman, <br>Quipwerx Support",

Kimberly Lee, host of the My Home Cooking television show and owner of her own restaurant chain, seems to know all the secrets. Her show has been on the air for over two years, and now she has a devoted group of followers around the country. When she sat down for an interview with US, she said that fresh vegetables and local produce are the key to cooking healthy and tasty food. <br>Ms. Lee is scheduled to publish her very first cookbook near the end of the month. The book is entitled Kimberly Lee’s My Home Cooking, and it provides easy-to- follow recipes that can be made in less than 30 minutes. Over 40,000 copies have already been pre-ordered so far. <br>Ms. Lee says that the final page of the book will include a detachable fan club membership form. Those who fill the form out and send it in to the provided address will receive a monthly newsletter and exclusive recipes available only to those in the fan club. Fan club members will also receive a password that allows access to a fan club website. <br><br>===========================<br><br>To: Kimberly Lee-kimberlylee@kimberlylee.com<br>From: Suzie Sanders - suziesanders@kimberlylee.com<br>Date: October 12<br>Subject: Update<br><br>Dear Ms. Lee, <br>Great news! I’m happy to report that not only has your book been selling well, but the number of new members joining the fan club has been increasing drastically since it was published. I’m certain that the article in the newspaper helped generate considerable publicity for your book. <br>Also, we have received a lot of feedback from new members expressing a desire for more recipes for cakes, cookies, and candies to be featured in next month’s newsletter. I think it would be a good idea to meet their needs this time. <br>Sincerely, <br><br>Suzie Sanders Publicity <br>Coordinator",
