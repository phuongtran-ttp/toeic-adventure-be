As you know, making hard copies requires the use of paper, toner, and other materials that impact the environment. It can also be expensive. Currently, departments are charged 5 cents per page, which can add up quickly. To minimize these environmental and financial impacts, consider accessing materials electronically whenever possible. <br>When hard copies are truly necessary, please limit your use of the copy machine to 25 copies per batch. This machine is intended for light use, and printing large batches could result in excessive wear and added maintenance and replacement costs. If a higher number of copies is needed, please submit a request to the Printing Center, located on the fourth floor. We have discontinued the paper printing request form and now only process orders from our electronic form on the employee resources Web page. Please contact your department secretary if you need assistance with this procedure. <br><br>Thank you for your cooperation. <br>Regards, <br>Joan Frinkel<br>Operations Supervisor",
