Could you tell me about what you did? <br>M-Au: Certainly. Many factory employees are told to never stop production line – no matter what. 66 Recently I took the opposite approach. Whenever we found a defect, anyone could stop the assembly line and address the problem immediately. <br>W-Br: 66 And this transition improved your quality control? <br>M-Au: Exactly. In fact, look at this production chart. You’ll see that, 67 compared to the other factories, cars from this one have far fewer defects. <br>"

Paso Tech, one of the leading producers of elements used in high-definition computer monitors and projectors, completed construction on one of three new factories to be built over the next four years. —[1]—. The first of the factories, built in Australia's Lonsdale, is the company’s most sizable factory and will eventually be responsible for 55% of the company’s output each year. <br>The new factory has brought with it an increase in jobs for local residents. —[2] —. More than 1,000 construction workers were hired to help build the massive factory and its surrounding structures. <br>Paso Tech's President Goro Hashimoto stated, “This was a major endeavor for our company. When we started this construction project, we realized that it was going to take a lot of money, resources, and staff. – [3] -. Not only did we hire locals to expand the physical plant, but we also added many workers to our full-time payroll. We hope to be able to do the same in Japan. We plan to begin building in Tokyo very soon. The company’s headquarters are currently located in Osaka, Japan. <br>Additional factories will be constructed in some of Paso Tech’s other locations, including in Brazil and South Africa. While the remaining factories will not be as large as the Lonsdale location, they will still require additional resources and labor. —[4] —•",

We feel that this merger will benefit both companies. Like us, Estefen specializes in commercial construction, and this merger will solidify our position at the forefront of the ever-growing Lexington City building trade. In addition, the creation of Trubridge Estefen will enable us to take on more complex development projects such as the Faust Center and the Hull Street Mall expansion.<br />\r\nMembers of each department will meet during the week of October 20 to discuss some of the logistical details of the merger, as well as the planned expansion and renovation of the Trubridge offices so they can effectively accommodate Estefens 113 employees. If you have questions you would like to see addressed during the meetings, please feel free to e-mail the meeting chairpersons in advance.<br />\r\nNote that both Stan Trubridge and Zack Estefen will attend each meeting.<br />\r\nTrubridge Contracting Acquisitions Committee<br />\r\n<br />\r\n---------------------------------------<br />\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse\" >\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td align=\"center\"><b>Department </b></td>\r\n\t\t\t<td align=\"center\"><b>Date/Time </b></td>\r\n\t\t\t<td align=\"center\"><b>Meeting Chairpersons </b></td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Administration</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Monday, Oct 20 9:00-11:00 AM</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Janine Wu, Office Manager {Trubridge Contracting)/ Ronaldo Romo, Office Manager (Estefen Builders)</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Public Relations</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Tuesday, Oct 21 1:00-3:00 PM</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Jim Hoyt, Public Relations Manager (Trubridge Contracting)</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Management</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Wednesday, Oct 22 1:00-3:00 PM.</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Eileen Crawford, Vice President (Trubridge Contracting)/ Larry Field, General Manager (Estefen Builders)</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Design</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Thursday, Oct 23 9:00-11:00 AM</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Laura Ward, Design Team Leader (Trubridge Contracting)/ Ann Sykes, Creative Director (Estefen Builders)</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<br />\r\nEstefen Builders does not have a public relations department.

It sounds like last Monday’s team planning  meeting was very productive. I had hoped to be there, but my last – minute trip to Toronto couldn’t be helped. Also, it looks like I am the last to comment on this e-mail discussion, so thank you for your patience. <br>Rosana, I appreciate the desire to locate in a spacious executive style office, but I really feel we shouldn’t compromise on the priority of being right in the heart of downtown. Is anyone familiar with Edmonton’s public transit system? It would help to know if using it to commute would be a possibility. <br>I also agree with Tom’s idea that we should have a presence at the technology fair in Edmonton. I will try to look into it next weekend when my wife and I go up to view some housing options. Also, I will be having lunch with an Edmonton executive who used to work for Silen Consultants, thanks to a connection made by Rosana. I will report any new insights learned. <br>Marcus Paulet, Silen Consultants",
