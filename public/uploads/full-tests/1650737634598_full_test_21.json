From your advertisement and especially from your customers&#39;s recommendations on your Web site, I expected to be completely satisfied with your services. Unfortunately, that was not the case. I requested your specialized service, but your cleaners did not provide that service. Clearly something went wrong. I am considering canceling the next scheduled visit.<br />\r\nDeborah Coe<br />\r\nAshbach Design<br />\r\n<br />\r\n===========================<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo: dcoe@ashbachdesign.com<br />\r\nFrom: pmedford@presnellcleaning.com<br />\r\nDate: August 16<br />\r\nSubject: Cleaning on August 11<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDear Ms. Coe:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe were very sorry to hear that you weren&#39;t happy with the service we provided. We are training several new cleaning staff members and they did not follow the correct cleaning plan. We promise you that we will do better to ensure that their work is properly conducted and inspected in the future.<br />\r\nWe would like another opportunity to clean your offices on August 18, at no charge. If the cleaning doesn&#39;t meet your standards, we will honor our guarantee. Please let me know if this is acceptable.<br />\r\nSincerely,<br />\r\nPatrick Medford<br />\r\nPresnell Cleaning Customer Service Representative",

        "text": "Attention Loyal Green Brew Customer! <br>Green Brew Cafe is redesigning our loyalty program - it's not just for coffee anymore! As a frequent customer, you're invited to participate in testing the new program. Interested? Go to greenbrew.com to read more and download the new Green Brew app. Then start accumulating points by enjoying our sandwiches, smoothies, and salads in addition to your favorite coffee drinks. When you post a review on our Web site, you will receive twenty extra points as a thank-you gift! <br><br>==========================<br><br>FinnD188 (8 July): Why is Green Brew changing its loyalty program? With the new program, the points system has changed. I have to buy twice as many coffee drinks to get a free one now. I like using the mobile app to pay, but I don't like the points. I think the program needs some rethinking before its official launch. <br>Alannah08 (14 July): Berthe's Beanery still has a punch card to earn free drinks - much simpler than this new system Green Brew is testing. I'll keep going to Green Brew as long as I can keep using my punch card, but when the new program replaces the old one completely, I'll probably go to Bertha's more often. <br>CoffeeBea (29 July): I was excited about the app, and it does make paying for purchases very easy. But it's much easier to earn drinks at other nearby cafe, and that's more important to me. I think Green Brew needs to make some changes before introducing the new system. <br><br>==========================<br><br><strong>A lesson in Loyalty</strong><br /><strong>By Hudson Aird</strong><br /><strong>27 August</strong><br />Maintaing customer loyalty can be difficult. Just ask Green Brew Cafe owner Taylah Carver. She recently began experimenting with a change to the cafe loyalty program to reward her regular customers. Instead of the old punch-card system, which rewarded customers for coffee purchases only, the new program allows customers to earn points for buying food items as well. The points are tracked through the Green Brew app, which customers download to their mobile devices. The app can also be used to pay for orders.<br />The program was originally scheduled to be introduced to the general public in September, but after nearly 60 customers tried out the app for a month, Carver decided to defer the launch. Most users liked the fact that the app allows them to pay using their mobile devices, but there were many complaints about the new points system. It now takes twice as many purchases before customers accumulate enough points to be eligible for a free coffee drink, and that was too much, reviewers said. The lesson, says Ms. Carver: know your customers",

            "text": "(C) He has not trained Mr. Mapleton before.",
            "explanation": "From the timeline of March 4-8, it can be seen that Mr. Mapleton went to the Power yoga class for the first session on March 6, but according to the email, Mr. Mapleton has not used his personal training session, and the week from March 4 is the last week prior to expiration. Thus, Mr. Mapleton's personal training session in this calendar can be inferred as his first, meaning that Mr. Pinto has never practiced for Mapleton before."
