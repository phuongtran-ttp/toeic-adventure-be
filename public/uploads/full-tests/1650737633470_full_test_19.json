To help ensure success in the next quarter, let me give you some updates about adjustments to personnel that have been instituted recently. <br>I am pleased to announce that Christine Moreau has been promoted to accounting supervisor. I have asked Xun Wong and his team to ensure that the responsibilities of Ms. Moreau's previous role as our budget specialist are covered while we work with human resources to recruit a permanent replacement. <br>As you know, Samir Abbas retired a few weeks ago after more than twenty years with the company. Taking his place as credit analyst is Claudia Sandoval. Ms. Sandoval has more than seven years of experience with New Zealand Credit Bank and should have no trouble acclimating to her new position here at Anbaum. Please take a moment to stop by her office in room 128 and introduce yourself. <br><br>Sincerely,<br>Sophie Jang, Finance Manager<br>Aubaum Company",

        "text": "From: Alton Gilman<br />\r\nTo: Myeong Kwan<br />\r\nDate: July 21<br />\r\nSubject: Follow-up<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDear Mr. Kwan,<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe spoke briefly after your session at the spring World Pipelines Conference about your company, Krestarr Group, organizing a training session for my engineering team at DQR Corporation. We had talked about two potential sessions, one on regulations for pipeline engineers regarding land use and one on the impact of pipelines on the environment. I would really like to make this happen when you are in Alberta for the fall conference.<br />\r\nThe Krestarr Group Web site states that your company&#39;s consulting fees are $500 for sessions with up to 10 participants, $750 for sessions with up to 15 participants, $1,000 for sessions with up to 20 participants, and $1,250 sessions with more than 20 participants. Is this information correct? I am looking forward to your prompt reply.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSincerely,<br />\r\nAlton Gilman<br />\r\n<br />\r\n--------------------------------------<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFrom: Myeong Kwan<br />\r\nTo: Alton Gilman<br />\r\nDate: July 22<br />\r\nSubject: Re: Follow up<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDear Mr. Gilman,<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI would be happy to give a session on land-use regulations to your team. My colleague, Aisha Wright, who handles environmental-impact training for our consulting firm, is also available. We will be at the conference on September 27 and 28. There&#39;s no guarantee that conference sessions would end early enough for us to give an evening workshop on those days. So it would probably be easiest for us to arrange for a session either right before or immediately after the conference.<br />\r\nI am available to give the training on the 26th, or Ms. Wright, who is staying in Alberta for a few days after I leave, could present her training session on the 29th. The training fees listed in your e-mail are correct. in the future you may be interested in additional seminars we offer on other topics of interest to environmental engineers, such as maintaining environmental sustainability and how to construct buildings that are energy efficient.<br />\r\nPlease confirm which date and training session would be best for your company. I look forward to hearing from you soon.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBest,<br />\r\nMyeong Kwan<br />\r\n<br />\r\n---------------------------------------------<br />\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width:406px;height:28px;\"><strong>Training Session Schedule</strong></td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width:406px;\"><strong>Session Presenter:&nbsp;</strong>Myeong Kwan<br />\r\n\t\t\t<strong>Date:&nbsp;</strong>September 26<br />\r\n\t\t\t<strong>Time:&nbsp;</strong>9:00 A.M-4:30 P.M(lunch break 12:00 P.M-1:00 P.M)<br />\r\n\t\t\t<strong>Location:</strong>&nbsp;Keats Conference Contre Conference Room 26B<br />\r\n\t\t\t<strong>Number of Participants:</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;Eighteen engineers</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</tbody>\r\n</table>",
