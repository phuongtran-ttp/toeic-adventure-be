So, 65 you’re writing an article for Forge Ahead Magazine? <br>W-Br: Yes, 65 the piece is about how your car manufacturing plant dramatically changed the way it produces cars. Could you tell me about what you did? <br>M-Au: Certainly. Many factory employees are told to never stop production line – no matter what. 66 Recently I took the opposite approach. Whenever we found a defect, anyone could stop the assembly line and address the problem immediately. <br>W-Br: 66 And this transition improved your quality control? <br>M-Au: Exactly. In fact, look at this production chart. You’ll see that, 67 compared to the other factories, cars from this one have far fewer defects. <br>"

        "text": "<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Long-Awaited Sequel Has Arrived</strong></div>\r\n(June 2) &mdash; David Mendoza&#39;s eagerly anticipated sequel to the best-selling <em>Waking Up</em> is finally here. The much loved <em>Waking Up</em> chronicled the ups and downs Mendoza experienced as he moved from job to job as a youth, working as everything from dock worker and fisherman, to hotel clerk and tennis<br />\r\ninstructor. <em>Life Lessons in Advertising</em> picks up where the previous book left off, with Mendoza having just arrived in New York City. We follow his rise from mailroom clerk to the head of M&amp;D Creative, a highly successful advertising agency.<br />\r\nWritten in the humorous, informal style that has made Mendoza&#39;s ads so successful over the years, the book shares stories of client case histories and reveals how he developed his most successful advertisements. The book is now available online and in bookstores everywhere.<br />\r\n<br>=================\r\n<br>Book Review: Life Lessons in Advertising\r\n<br>By Julia Turnbull\r\n<br>Given that it took twenty years for David Mendoza\td\r\nto write his second book, Life Lessons in Advertising, the impression the reader is left with at the end is that\r\nhe forgot to edit his work. While 1 thoroughly enjoyed Mendoza’s previous book, this sequel is made up of dull, complicated sentences that make reading a chore. There’s no argument regarding his abilities as an advertising executive, yet the anecdotes about life in the advertising business arc so much less engaging than those earlier stories that almost jumped off the pages. For example, nothing matches the earlier book’s crystal clear descriptions of his escapades and unexpected adventures as a hotel clerk in northern Montana. This is one book you can skip. \r\n\r\n<br>=================\r\n\r\n<i><br>Advertising in Motion Magazine\r\n<br>A minute with...\r\n<br>Advertising guru David Mendoza</i>\r\n<br><br><b>AIMM:</b>\tWhy did it take you so long to write this book?\r\n<br><b>Mendoza:</b> It's funny. I've always considered my copywriting to be my strength. But long pieces of writing, like manuscripts, are very difficult for me, so 1 take my time to edit them carefully. But I'm very proud of the end result-—it's easy to read and highly enjoyable, just like my first book.\r\n<br><b>AIMM:</b> You've held so many jobs, like fisherman and tennis instructor. Why do you think advertising stuck?\r\n<br><b>Mendoza:</b> I'm not so sure it did really stick, although I've been with it for a while. My philosophy is to be open to any opportunity that comes my way. Advertising came my way, but I'm rather sure it's not the last thing I'll try my hand at And you never know, 1 might go back to fishing or tennis.",

I’m with the electrical contractors at the former Millway train station site now. The electrical system was in worse shape than we had originally thought. The rewiring and upgrades are going to cost more than expected because we want to modernize while still retaining the historical integrity of the building.I’ll send over the estimate as soon as I receive it. I’m hoping that all the work will be completed so that we can open as planned in May.<br>======================================<br><b>New Hotel to Open in South Wales</b><br> CARDIFF (18 April)—The Millway Road Hotel is scheduled to open on 14 May. The building  was once a busy train station that was designed by Arthur Lewison over 150 years ago.<br> For almost three decades the building had been left unoccupied. It was purchased two years ago by Steffan Griffiths, president of Griffiths Hoteliers.<br>According to project coordinator Fausto Forletti, the old building required extensive renovation not only to turn it into a hotel but also to update the electrical, heating, and plumbing systems.<br> The hotel has 25 guest rooms, a meeting room, and a restaurant with banquet facilities. All of Mr. Griffths' facilities are noted for their world-class dining experiences. The hotel’s Bayside Cafe has award-winning Welsh chef Mal Davies to create a menu and oversee the restaurant.<br> In the near future, Mr. Griffiths plans to expand the property’s garden.

As a computer technician, I was pleasantly surprised to find that it had such up-to-date facilities.
