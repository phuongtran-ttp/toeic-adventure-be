Could you tell me about what you did? <br>M-Au: Certainly. Many factory employees are told to never stop production line – no matter what. 66 Recently I took the opposite approach. Whenever we found a defect, anyone could stop the assembly line and address the problem immediately. <br>W-Br: 66 And this transition improved your quality control? <br>M-Au: Exactly. In fact, look at this production chart. You’ll see that, 67 compared to the other factories, cars from this one have far fewer defects. <br>"

As you know, this meeting is a great opportunity for US to assess our operating plan and to make any adjustments that might help US keep up with constant changes in the marketplace. As an advertising agency, it&rsquo;s crucial we stay informed about the newest market trends. Therefore, I was excited when I heard that Tsuyoshi Ito, manager of our Japanese branch, would be visiting this Friday. In order to take advantage of his expertise and knowledge, I would like to change the meeting date so that Mr. Ito can attend.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis will be Mr. Ito&rsquo;s first time in the country, so I would like you to pick him up from the airport. A company car will be provided to you for this purpose. I will e-mail again once I have more details concerning Mr. Ito&rsquo;s arrival time.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSincerely,<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSam Miller<br />\r\nPresident<br />\r\nMiller Advertising",

The service allows users to go online and browse hundreds of recipes. They select the recipes they like and have the ingredients, with cooking instructionsshipped to them on a weekly basis. Ms. Mishra first thought of the idea she observed her friends&rsquo; hectic lives. &ldquo;My friends were too busy to plan, shop, and cook for themselves,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;Most nights they would go to a restaurant and get takeout food. Some wanted to cook at home in their kitchens but didn&rsquo;t feel confident in their abilities.&rdquo; Ms. Mishra has found a way to streamline the whole process. Fine Fresh Foods works with local suppliers&mdash;often small farms&mdash;that are required to be organic. The focus on working with local partners, as well as the convenience and reasonable price of the service, has made the business extremely popular. At the moment, Fine when Fresh Foods delivers only within Kelowna but expansion to other areas is planned in the coming year.<br />\r\n<strong>=========================</strong>\r\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width:638px;\">Pennington Farm is teaming up with Fine Fresh Foods!

I know this was an area of stress for you in the fourth quarter of last year, so I wanted to give you plenty of advanced warning. You will need to bring your numbers up significantly if you want to pass the review. As you know, we have been struggling to make our sales goals over the past several years, and I am afraid Mr. Jones is determined to trim the staff if things don&#39;t change. I have far exceeded my target numbers, so I have included an attachment with some possible leads for sales. Give them a shot.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGood luck,<br />\r\nJames<br />\r\n<br />\r\n===========================<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo: James Holt <holtrain@zipnet.net><br />\r\nFrom: Aaron Donald <adonald@acemail.com><br />\r\nDate: Jan. 12<br />\r\nSubject: First Quarter Performance Review<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJames,<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThank you so much for the leads. I will get on them right away. I don&#39;t know why my sales are slumping so much lately in the technologies division. It seems like every sales technique 1 learned in school isn&#39;t working anymore. I am thinking about changing industries if I don&#39;t pass our review when it comes out in March. My sister is opening a beauty parlor and she was asking me to become a barber. Imagine that! Anyway, thank you again for the notice about the possible layoffs coming up. I will try to get my numbers up to standards, but I think that Mr. Jones may have already decided to let me go.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAll the best,<br />\r\nAaron<br />\r\n<br />\r\n===========================<br />\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Possible Sales Leads for January</strong></div>\r\n\r\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse\" >\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr bgcolor=\"lavender\">\r\n\t\t\t<td align=\"center\"><b>Name </b></td>\r\n\t\t\t<td align=\"center\"><b>Division </b></td>\r\n\t\t\t<td align=\"center\"><b>Account Potential </b></td>\r\n\t\t\t<td align=\"center\"><b>Rating </b></td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td align=\"center\">Sally Jones</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Technologies</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td align=\"center\">$35,000-$50,000</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td align=\"center\">Silver</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td align=\"center\">Bod Knuddle</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Technologies</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td align=\"center\">$100,000 and up</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td align=\"center\">Gold</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td align=\"center\">Marquise Lee</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Technologies</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td align=\"center\">$12,000-$20,000</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td align=\"center\">Bronze/Silver</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</adonald@acemail.com></holtrain@zipnet.net></holtrain@zipnet.net></adonald@acemail.com>",
