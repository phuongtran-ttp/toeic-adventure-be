While most buses stop running by 1:00 A.M., some parts of downtown will see buses running all night. The Bingham shopping district will also see buses running until 3:00 A.M. “This is when we have the most tourists and out-of-town folks coming to visit,” explained Mayor Bill Nate. “We felt it was important to provide the necessary services during this time.” - [3] - When the bus drivers’ union leader, Nathan Reiner, was asked about the new schedules he responded, \"We worked out a payment that is agreeable on both sides and have enough drivers that can work in shifts so that there is no danger of overworking or exhaustion. Many of US will still get some time off during the holidays with our families.” - [4] –",

        "text": "Attention Loyal Green Brew Customer! <br>Green Brew Cafe is redesigning our loyalty program - it's not just for coffee anymore! As a frequent customer, you're invited to participate in testing the new program. Interested? Go to greenbrew.com to read more and download the new Green Brew app. Then start accumulating points by enjoying our sandwiches, smoothies, and salads in addition to your favorite coffee drinks. When you post a review on our Web site, you will receive twenty extra points as a thank-you gift! <br><br>==========================<br><br>FinnD188 (8 July): Why is Green Brew changing its loyalty program? With the new program, the points system has changed. I have to buy twice as many coffee drinks to get a free one now. I like using the mobile app to pay, but I don't like the points. I think the program needs some rethinking before its official launch. <br>Alannah08 (14 July): Berthe's Beanery still has a punch card to earn free drinks - much simpler than this new system Green Brew is testing. I'll keep going to Green Brew as long as I can keep using my punch card, but when the new program replaces the old one completely, I'll probably go to Bertha's more often. <br>CoffeeBea (29 July): I was excited about the app, and it does make paying for purchases very easy. But it's much easier to earn drinks at other nearby cafe, and that's more important to me. I think Green Brew needs to make some changes before introducing the new system. <br><br>==========================<br><br><strong>A lesson in Loyalty</strong><br /><strong>By Hudson Aird</strong><br /><strong>27 August</strong><br />Maintaing customer loyalty can be difficult. Just ask Green Brew Cafe owner Taylah Carver. She recently began experimenting with a change to the cafe loyalty program to reward her regular customers. Instead of the old punch-card system, which rewarded customers for coffee purchases only, the new program allows customers to earn points for buying food items as well. The points are tracked through the Green Brew app, which customers download to their mobile devices. The app can also be used to pay for orders.<br />The program was originally scheduled to be introduced to the general public in September, but after nearly 60 customers tried out the app for a month, Carver decided to defer the launch. Most users liked the fact that the app allows them to pay using their mobile devices, but there were many complaints about the new points system. It now takes twice as many purchases before customers accumulate enough points to be eligible for a free coffee drink, and that was too much, reviewers said. The lesson, says Ms. Carver: know your customers",

The hosing was listed as capable of handling up to 1,000 pounds of pressure per square inch (psi). My company, Advanced Dynamic Cleaning, refitted all of our pressure washers with your hosing at considerable cost and time. Every single one of our pressure washers failed somewhere along the hosing from the joint of the gun to the compressor. Our compressors only create 500 psi, so I have to conclude that there is some defect in the design of your hose. I would like to get a refund of my purchase or a replacement of my order with hosing that meets industry standards. I have included my purchase order and a copy of the invoice.<br><br>Sincerely,<br>Jose Ramos<br>===========================<br><br>To:Jose Ramos - jramos.zipnet.com <br>From: Raquel Jenkins- cservice@starproducts.com <br>Date:October 16<br>Subject:Defective Hose<br><br>Dear Mr. Ramos,<br><br>We have received your report of a defective hose and reviewed the attached documents. We really value your business and hate that you went through such a waste of time and energy with our hosing. However, I am afraid to say that the mistake may be on your end. In looking over your purchase, you clearly ordered XP100 hosing X 5,000 yards. If you look at the specs for that hosing, it is only rated at appropriate for 100 psi. This could explain why all of your hosing failed. What I can offer you is an exchange of the remaining XP100 hosing in your inventory for a hosing more appropriate to your needs. We will do this at no charge and pay for the shipping as a show of our appreciation for your business. Please fill out the purchase order that I have attached and include it with the XP100 hosing when you ship it back to US for exchange.<br><br>Thank you,<br>Raquel Jenkins<br>===========================<br>@PS@/onthisinhvien.appspot.com/images/6789034_1592552433067.png@PE@<br>===========================",
