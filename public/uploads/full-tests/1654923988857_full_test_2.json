As you know, this meeting is a great opportunity for US to assess our operating plan and to make any adjustments that might help US keep up with constant changes in the marketplace. As an advertising agency, it&rsquo;s crucial we stay informed about the newest market trends. Therefore, I was excited when I heard that Tsuyoshi Ito, manager of our Japanese branch, would be visiting this Friday. In order to take advantage of his expertise and knowledge, I would like to change the meeting date so that Mr. Ito can attend.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis will be Mr. Ito&rsquo;s first time in the country, so I would like you to pick him up from the airport. A company car will be provided to you for this purpose. I will e-mail again once I have more details concerning Mr. Ito&rsquo;s arrival time.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSincerely,<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSam Miller<br />\r\nPresident<br />\r\nMiller Advertising",

He had publicly indicated his desire to retire in order to write a memoir of his long career in fashion, over thirty years of which were spent at Hochstein. Nevertheless, most experts had expected him to stay on until after November, when the company's winter collection is released. <br><br>Ferrara's move has generated much speculation about who will take her place at Barrault Bondy. Sources there indicate that current design director Marcel Hugo will be named the new executive vice president in a press release later this week.",

The most serious violation concerned the improper storage and labeling of food. All ingredients stored for later use must be labeled with an exact date and detailed contents. If we do not label containers properly, spoiled food could accidently be served to customers. We received relatively low grades for employee hygiene and the cleanliness of our facilities. All employees are required to wear their uniform and hairnet at all times and wash their hands after every bathroom visit. We also need to mop floors more often and keep them dry. <br>In order to correct these poor situations, I will be posting a checklist that all employees will be required to complete every morning. It will include necessary preparations to ensure that we are not breaking any regulations. This measure will go into effect on January 29. <br>If you have any questions about these changes, please bring them up at the staff meeting tomorrow. <br><br>===========================<br> <br><h3 align = \"center\"> NOTICE TO ALL EMPLOYEES</h3><br>The checklist below must be signed by every employee on every day that they have a shift  at Polito’s Pizza. Only sign the task once it has been completed or checked. Failure to fill out the checklist with the date, time, and signature will be treated as a violation of Polito’s  new health standards.<br><br><b>POLITO’S CHECKLIST</b> <br><br>  <table align =\"center\"  border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0  style=border-collapse:collapse > <tr>  <td align =\"center\"> <b> Polito’s </b> </td>  <td align =\"center\"> <b> Sun</b> </td> <td align =\"center\"> <b> Mon</b> </td>  <td align =\"center\"> <b> Tue</b> </td>  <td align =\"center\"> <b> Wen</b> </td>  <td align =\"center\"> <b> Thu</b> </td>  <td align =\"center\"> <b> Fri</b> </td>  <td align =\"center\"> <b> Sat</b> </td>   </tr> <tr> <td align =\"center\"> Rotate Food </td> <td align =\"center\"> K.P.</td> <td align =\"center\"> K.P.</td> <td align =\"center\">K.P. </td> <td align =\"center\"> K.P. </td> <td align =\"center\">  </td> <td> </td> <td align =\"center\"> K.P.</td>  </tr> <tr> <td align =\"center\"> Mop Floors </td> <td align =\"center\"> K.P.</td> <td align =\"center\"> K.P.</td> <td align =\"center\">K.P. </td> <td align =\"center\"> K.P. </td> <td align =\"center\">  </td> <td> </td> <td align =\"center\"> K.P.</td>  </tr> <tr> <td align =\"center\"> Uniforms </td> <td align =\"center\"> K.P.</td> <td align =\"center\"> K.P.</td> <td align =\"center\">K.P. </td> <td align =\"center\"> K.P. </td> <td align =\"center\">  </td> <td> </td> <td align =\"center\"> K.P.</td>  </tr> <tr> <td align =\"center\"> Wash hands </td> <td align =\"center\"> K.P.</td> <td align =\"center\"> K.P.</td> <td align =\"center\">K.P. </td> <td align =\"center\"> K.P. </td> <td align =\"center\">  </td> <td> </td> <td align =\"center\"> K.P.</td>  </tr></table>",

When she sat down for an interview with US, she said that fresh vegetables and local produce are the key to cooking healthy and tasty food. <br>Ms. Lee is scheduled to publish her very first cookbook near the end of the month. The book is entitled Kimberly Lee’s My Home Cooking, and it provides easy-to- follow recipes that can be made in less than 30 minutes. Over 40,000 copies have already been pre-ordered so far. <br>Ms. Lee says that the final page of the book will include a detachable fan club membership form. Those who fill the form out and send it in to the provided address will receive a monthly newsletter and exclusive recipes available only to those in the fan club. Fan club members will also receive a password that allows access to a fan club website. <br><br>===========================<br><br>To: Kimberly Lee-kimberlylee@kimberlylee.com<br>From: Suzie Sanders - suziesanders@kimberlylee.com<br>Date: October 12<br>Subject: Update<br><br>Dear Ms. Lee, <br>Great news!
