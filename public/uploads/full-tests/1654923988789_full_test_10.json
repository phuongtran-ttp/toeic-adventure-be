Moreover, it will give visitors a better vantage from which to view these beautiful creatures. <br><br>We are pleased to inform you that your name will be listed with the names of other donors on a commemorative plaque at the entrance to the African Savannah enclosure. As a further token of our appreciation, please accept a full season pass, which will allow you and one guest to enter at no charge. It will arrive this week in a separate letter. <br><br>Thank you again for your support. We look forward to your next visit to the zoo. <br><br>Yours sincerely, <br><br>Joseph Ihimaera <br> Associate Director <br> Friends of the Waitakere Zoo",

The number of tourists who travel in campers, motor homes, and other recreational vehicles (RVs) has increased significantly nationwide. While the proportion of visitors who arrive by RV is still small compared to more traditional tourists, I am sure you will agree that forcing RV tourists to leave every evening only compromises our efforts to promote tourism, which is connected to a substantial amount of income for our city. We are confident that making Olsenburg “RV friendly” will benefit the local tourism industry and its employees. Three nearby cities that have lifted similar bans have reported positive results. Tocasta Town, Gamma Village, and Arcoda City are evidence that welcoming RV tourists can promote tourism, generating more reverse for restaurants and local shops. Next month, Arcoda City will even begin adding special RV parking areas in its parks.<br><br>As you know, the tourism and food service industries employ over 25 percent of our workforce. Currently, however, many of our visitors are here only during the daytime, so we are losing business to neighboring cities. RV tourism would not compete with hotel tourism. In fact, it would only increase the total number of visitors to our city.<br><br>I look forward to seeing you at the meeting next Thursday, where the city council will address this important issue.<br><br>Respectfully yours,<br>Linda Defrey<br>Senior Vice President of  overnmental Affairs<br> Olsenburg Business Association",

The hosing was listed as capable of handling up to 1,000 pounds of pressure per square inch (psi). My company, Advanced Dynamic Cleaning, refitted all of our pressure washers with your hosing at considerable cost and time. Every single one of our pressure washers failed somewhere along the hosing from the joint of the gun to the compressor. Our compressors only create 500 psi, so I have to conclude that there is some defect in the design of your hose. I would like to get a refund of my purchase or a replacement of my order with hosing that meets industry standards. I have included my purchase order and a copy of the invoice.<br><br>Sincerely,<br>Jose Ramos<br>===========================<br><br>To:Jose Ramos - jramos.zipnet.com <br>From: Raquel Jenkins- cservice@starproducts.com <br>Date:October 16<br>Subject:Defective Hose<br><br>Dear Mr. Ramos,<br><br>We have received your report of a defective hose and reviewed the attached documents. We really value your business and hate that you went through such a waste of time and energy with our hosing. However, I am afraid to say that the mistake may be on your end. In looking over your purchase, you clearly ordered XP100 hosing X 5,000 yards. If you look at the specs for that hosing, it is only rated at appropriate for 100 psi. This could explain why all of your hosing failed. What I can offer you is an exchange of the remaining XP100 hosing in your inventory for a hosing more appropriate to your needs. We will do this at no charge and pay for the shipping as a show of our appreciation for your business. Please fill out the purchase order that I have attached and include it with the XP100 hosing when you ship it back to US for exchange.<br><br>Thank you,<br>Raquel Jenkins<br>===========================<br>@PS@/onthisinhvien.appspot.com/images/6789034_1592552433067.png@PE@<br>===========================",

I am majoring in industrial engineering here, and my liquid dynamics professor, Dr. Alcobar, recommended Master stroke Industries as a possible internship opportunity. Your company is recognized as a leader in flow research. If you would be willing to accept an intern for the coming spring semester, I could give you up to 15 hours per week of work, provided that you are able to write some performance evaluations that I could turn in to Dr. Alcobar for credit. Thank you for your consideration, and if you would like to see my transcript, I would be happy to forward it to you. <br>All the best, Carl Ennens<br><br>==========================<br><br> To: Carl Ennens (cennens@gmail.com)<br>From: John Masterson (jmasterson@masterstrokeindustries.com)<br> Date: December 31<br>Subject: Internship <br> <br>Dear Carl Ennens, <br>I appreciate your interest in interning with US here at Master Stroke Industries. We have not accepted a lot of interns in the past, but I know Dr. Alcobar personally, and if he recommended that you contact US, he must have faith in your ability. I think we should set up an interview at our headquarters downtown on Holly street. We can get to know each other a bit over some coffee and I will show you around our facilities. Don't worry about your transcripts; like I said, if Dr. Alcobar thinks you’ll be a good fit, I’ll trust his judgment. How about this coming Friday at 10 A.M.? <br><br>Look forward to meeting you Carl, <br>John Masterson<br>CEO, Master stroke Industries<br><br>==========================<br><br><h4 align =\"center\"> Memorandum To Master stroke Industry Employees </h4><br>This spring, at Master stroke Industries, we will have an intern assisting US with everything from making coffee to solving complex equations. Carl Ennens is a student here at the University and has kindly offered his services in exchange for a piece of our operational knowledge. Please treat him with respect and don’t be afraid to use him for an extra pair of hands, eyes, or opinion should you need it. And I did hear he makes a good cup of coffee!",
