They possess a number of studios that are capable of producing cutting edge quality 3-D films. This will allow our company to begin producing 3-D films. <b> Q2 And why wouldn’t we</b>? The majority of our films are science fiction, and I believe a transition into 3-D is an excellent path for US. I have ensured that we will have full access to Walker Studio’s equipment, and in return they will become a shareholder in our company. <b> Q3 I suggest that our studio staff should spend the next following weeks studying how this new type of equipment works, so we can begin producing content as soon as possible.</b>"

That’s where she has captured all the images in her latest book of photography, Beneath the Bright Blue Sea.<br>Ms. Nannup began taking pictures when her father gave her an easy-to-use instant camera for her fifth birthday. When she went to university, however, she put the camera down to pursue a career in print journalism.<br>After she graduated, Ms. Nannup was hired as a staff writer by the Perth Daily Tribune and had little time for taking pictures. That changed when she attended an underwater photography workshop while on vacation in Bali, Indonesia.There her interest in photography was renewed, and she eventually left her job at the newspaper to devote herself to photography full-time.<br>Although she started with a child’s instant camera, Ms. Nannup now works with advanced underwater cameras. To deal with wear and tear, she updates her equipment every few years. “Salt water and sand pose challenges for underwater photography equipment beyond those that an everyday camera would face,” she said.<br> After years now of diving and taking pictures, she has yet to tire of her profession. “I still love being able to show people images of creatures and places that they have never seen,” says Ms. Nannup.<br>Most of Ms. Nannup’s work, including her latest release, focuses on the ocean around Australia. In May, however, she will travel to Greece to photograph underwater ruins in the Mediterranean for her next book.<br>Visit www.saranannup.com.au for more information on Ms. Nannup and her work.",

I noticed that the library recently built the Media Lab with funds raised by library patrons. I was hoping to change classrooms in order to use my new educational resources by integrating computers into my English conversation class. Could you please reschedule my class to be provided in the same classroom as Never Too Late to Learn instead of the Education Center? I think my students will appreciate the practical English skills they can learn on computers. Also, could you please send an e-mail to all of the students who have signed up for the class? They will need to be informed about the room change.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThank you in advance for your assistance,<br />\r\nLinda Carter<br />\r\n<br />\r\n===========================<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo: Richard White - rwhite@newtonlibrary.edu<br />\r\nFrom: Linda Carter - lcarter121@seprus.com<br />\r\nDate: April 2 Subject: Room Change<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDear Ms. Carter,<br />\r\nI would be happy to move your Beginners English Conversation course to the classroom with the updated media lab; for your reference, this is room 3A. Unfortunately, I do not have the emails for all of the students who signed up for your course. Many students only provided their names. I could post a sign at the entrance to the library advertising your course and make a note of the room change, if that would be acceptable for you. Please let me know if you would like me to do this.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThank you and all the best,<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRichard White<br />\r\nLibrary Projects Coordinator",

With over 3 million members nationwide, our franchise has become known as a reputable and trustworthy brand. Our success is a result of great relationships between US the franchiser and our franchisees.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou are receiving this mailing because you expressed interest in partnering with 24/7 Fitness in order to open a new location in your town. According to our preliminary research, your town has a large population of young, single people working in the professional field. This is our target demographic, and it means the business outlook for your 24/7 Fitness location is positive in your town. If you would like more information about the specific terms and regulations when partnering with 24/7 Fitness, please don&#39;t hesitate to call me at 347-555-3363. Additionally, if you would like to talk to another franchise owner, that information can be supplied by one of our associates.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSincerely,<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLori Swanson<br />\r\nChief Operating Officer<br />\r\n<br />\r\n==========================<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em>To: Zack Carter - zcarter@zenmail.com<br />\r\nFrom: John Morris - jmorris@cbnet.com<br />\r\nSubject: 24/7 Fitness<br />\r\nDate: March 6</em><br />\r\n<br />\r\nDear Mr. Carter,<br />\r\nMy name is John Morris and I am a small business owner living in the Millville area. I am currently in negotiations with 24/7 Fitness to open my own location here in Millville. As someone who works with 24/7 Fitness, you would help me a lot by sharing your opinions.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI am interested in how you assess 24/7 Fitness as a franchiser. I operated several franchises in the past, and I always found that trust and honesty are the most important factors in a successful relationship. More importantly, I was also wondering what kind of support is provided by the parent company. Before opening your location, did you receive adequate training to allow you to smoothly begin operating your business? Any advice you can give me would be much appreciated.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSincerely,<br />\r\nJohn Morris<br />\r\n<br />\r\n===========================<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em>To: John Morris&nbsp; - jmorris@cbnet.com<br />\r\nFrom: Zack Carter - zcarter@zenmail.com<br />\r\nSubject: 24/7 Fitness<br />\r\nDate: March 7</em><br />\r\n<br />\r\nDear Mr. Morris,<br />\r\nI am happy to provide some insight into the operation of a 24/7 Fitness franchise. I have been working with 24/7 Fitness as a franchise owner for 10 years now. I actually run three different branches now. I completely agree with you that trust and honesty are the two most important aspects of any business relationship. On that count, I believe the fact that I own three franchises is testament to my faith in the franchiser.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLet me put your mind at ease. First off, 24/7 Fitness has a very specific way that they want their brand to develop no matter who owns the branch. The parent company will not only provide training, but they insist on controlling the actual layout of the facilities from the locker rooms to the free weights. They want any of their 3 million members to be able to walk into any one of their gyms and feel at home. Until you have been operating for one full year, you must make monthly reports to corporate headquarters detailing all aspects of sales, membership, and a flow chart describing the usage of the facilities. It really is hands on until they have confidence you can represent the brand. I hope this helps you decide to join the 24/7 Fitness team!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAll the best,<br />\r\nZack Carter",
