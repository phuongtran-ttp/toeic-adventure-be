The Nightingales of Fall is the eagerly awaited sequel to his best¬selling debut novel, The Swallows of spring. The book follows the journey of Sally Harknett through the weird world of Underfell, mixing social commentary with sharp wit and just a dash of magic and mystery. Tepper burst onto the scene over a decade ago with the acclaimed poetry collection, King Harmon’s Castle, and the expectation for this latest novel is another chart-topping success. Later this week, the first editions will be made available in a prize drawing at the New York Book Fair, with the official launch at major bookstores next month.",

Kimberly Lee, host of the My Home Cooking television show and owner of her own restaurant chain, seems to know all the secrets. Her show has been on the air for over two years, and now she has a devoted group of followers around the country. When she sat down for an interview with US, she said that fresh vegetables and local produce are the key to cooking healthy and tasty food. <br>Ms. Lee is scheduled to publish her very first cookbook near the end of the month. The book is entitled Kimberly Lee’s My Home Cooking, and it provides easy-to- follow recipes that can be made in less than 30 minutes. Over 40,000 copies have already been pre-ordered so far. <br>Ms. Lee says that the final page of the book will include a detachable fan club membership form. Those who fill the form out and send it in to the provided address will receive a monthly newsletter and exclusive recipes available only to those in the fan club. Fan club members will also receive a password that allows access to a fan club website. <br><br>===========================<br><br>To: Kimberly Lee-kimberlylee@kimberlylee.com<br>From: Suzie Sanders - suziesanders@kimberlylee.com<br>Date: October 12<br>Subject: Update<br><br>Dear Ms. Lee, <br>Great news! I’m happy to report that not only has your book been selling well, but the number of new members joining the fan club has been increasing drastically since it was published. I’m certain that the article in the newspaper helped generate considerable publicity for your book. <br>Also, we have received a lot of feedback from new members expressing a desire for more recipes for cakes, cookies, and candies to be featured in next month’s newsletter. I think it would be a good idea to meet their needs this time. <br>Sincerely, <br><br>Suzie Sanders Publicity <br>Coordinator",

This year we have updated our conference room with new projectors and more comfortable seating. We will be providing shuttle busses from the airport and a premium buffet in the dining hall as well as an Internet café where guests can use computers or print documents at no cost. For your convenience, we will also be providing useful supplies such as flip charts, 10-foot whiteboards, and projector screens. <br>Once you decide on a date, we ask that you please make a down payment of $1,000 after we see if it is available. The remaining balance should be paid upon your arrival. Also, we ask that as the organizer of the event, you arrive at the conference center a day before the conference begins. This way, any unforeseen circumstances can be taken care of beforehand. <br>We appreciate your business with the Titus Conference Center again. We are looking forward to providing you with the best service possible. <br><br>Stacey Watkins, <br>Director<br><br>===========================<br><br>From:Ann Rose (annrose@putkincomp.com)<br>To: Stacey Watkins (staceywatkins@titus.com)<br>Subject: RE: Conference of Bank Managers <br>Date: February 16<br><br>Dear Mr. Watkins, <br>I am also pleased to be working with you again this year. We would like to reserve your conference space for the weekend of August 15 to 16. Additionally, the down payment will be handled by our financial department. I will have one of the employees contact you soon. <br>There is one thing that I would like to tell you. Actually, last year, some of our attendees were disappointed because the dining hall didn’t offer a variety of vegetarian options. I hope this inconvenience will be dealt with in advance this year. <br><br>Thank you, <br>Ann Rose<br>Organizer, Annual Conference of Bank Managers",

Don't worry about your transcripts; like I said, if Dr. Alcobar thinks you’ll be a good fit, I’ll trust his judgment.

Please treat him with respect and don’t be afraid to use him for an extra pair of hands, eyes, or opinion should you need it. And I did hear he makes a good cup of coffee!",

We work with productivity and efficiency training for corporations and small businesses. Lately, our staff has been suffering from low morale, and while searching the Internet for solutions, I came across your website www.action.net. I am interested in hearing more about the motivational speaking that you do. Specifically, could you tell me if your speeches are religious in nature? We have a diverse staff and I am looking for something that is secular.

I am happy to answer your questions and provide you with a full breakdown of what we can do for you, your team, and your company. To begin with, all of our talks are secular, though not necessarily free from the concept of spirituality. Our professional speakers seek to motivate people to look internally to find their own spirit and help it rise. Morale, after all, is an intangible but essential aspect of an effective team. Please refer to the topic list and pricing guide I have attached to this e-mail. Once you have found a theme, speaker, and chosen the appropriate class size for your company, please send me a follow-up e-mail to schedule your event.<br />\r\nBill Johnson,<br />\r\nAction Coordinator<br />\r\n<br />\r\n=========================<br />\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>STARGATE CONVENTION CENTER SCHEDULE OF EVENTS</strong><br />\r\n&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"10\" cellspacing=\"10\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse\" >\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td align=\"center\"><b>Theme </b></td>\r\n\t\t\t<td align=\"center\"><b>Location </b></td>\r\n\t\t\t<td align=\"center\"><b>Speaker</b></td>\r\n\t\t\t<td align=\"center\"><b>Class Size </b></td>\r\n\t\t\t<td align=\"center\"><b>Duration </b></td>\r\n\t\t\t<td align=\"center\"><b>Price</b></td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td align=\"center\">Stay in the Moment!</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td align=\"center\">On Site</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td align=\"center\">Jim Grey</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td align=\"center\">15-20</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td align=\"center\">3 hours</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td align=\"center\">$450</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td align=\"center\">New You Everyday</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td align=\"center\">Off Site</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td align=\"center\">Darlene</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td align=\"center\">20-25</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td align=\"center\">3 hours</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td align=\"center\">$400</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td align=\"center\">Stay Positive for the Team!</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td align=\"center\">Off Site</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td align=\"center\">Jeff Boxer</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td align=\"center\">15-30</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td align=\"center\">3 hours</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td align=\"center\">$400</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td align=\"center\">Blessed are We All</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td align=\"center\">Off Site</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td align=\"center\">John Brown</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td align=\"center\">20-30</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td align=\"center\">4 hours</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td align=\"center\">$500</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</tbody>\r\n</table>",

The 88-year-old company has been Denmark's leading skincare brand and the top selling cream, Xtreme 7, has been Europe's most popular facial cream for over 10 years. Though Americans may not have had access to these creams before, the brand is already generating much excitement. Dermatologist Dr. Francis Keenan explains, \"Tests have shown that Xtreme 7 dramatically reduces the fine lines around the eye area and laugh lines after only 30 days of use, but the price of the cream is only a fraction of what department store brands sell for. I'll definitely recommend this cream to my clients.\" <br>\"People have been asking about Xtreme 7 but the products haven't even arrived yet!\" added Susan Chan, an employee at a beauty counter. \"People are already calling in to pre-order.\" <br>A spokesperson for the company explained that Brand-X is making moves to expand into the North American and Asian markets. For now, only the best-selling line will be available sometime next month, outside of Europe, but within a year, more products will be available<br><br>==========================<br><br><h4 align =\"center\"> Brand-X Positions at American Headquarters in Westminster, California</h4>Don’t miss your chance to work in an exciting career in skincare and beauty with Brand-X. 80 administrative and customer service positions will be available regardless of experience. Applicants need to have good communication skills, bilingual ability in both English and Spanish is preferred but not necessary, and knowledge in computer use is a must. Applicants with experience in cosmetics, dermatology, or marketing will get a chance to work in several management positions for Brand-X. Please visit our website at www.brandx.com/jobs for more information. You can fill out the application forms and send them in before March 20th. Interviews will take place at Hillway Building on 143 Garden Road. Be sure to bring your resumes and reference letters. <br><br>===========================<br><br>To: Professor David Mills<br>From: Jacqueline O’Hare<br>Date: March 28<br>Subject:  Job<br><br>Dear Professor Mills, <br>Thank you so much for the reference letter you supplied me with. I was recently hired by Brand-X and I begin my orientations next week Wednesday at 10:00 A.M. However, we have our statistics test at that time. Is there any way that I can take a make-up test at a different time or hand in another assignment as a replacement for the test? I would hate to miss the orientations which are mandatory and I don't want to disappoint my new employers. The job should not have any other impact on my school work otherwise. I kindly appreciate your consideration in this. <br>Sincerely, <br>Jacqueline O’Hare",
