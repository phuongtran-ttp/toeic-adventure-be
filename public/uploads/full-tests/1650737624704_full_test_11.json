Many Canadian residents of Brentwood are resentful of the large crowds in their tiny town and Lockland residents have complained that the closest American Cashco is located almost 5 hours away. - [3] - \"I'm very excited,\" said Lockland resident Janice Burrows. 'T heard it'll be huge. Maybe Canadians might start coming here to shop. But all kidding aside, we've been petitioning for a branch here for a long time.\" - [4] - The new Lockland Cashco is rumored to become one of the largest warehouses in America with full petrol service, pet center, restaurant, cafeterias, garden center, and medical clinic.",

I see we were charged $95 dollars for each time you serviced our offices. This is what we had initially agreed upon and have been paying for your services since last j year at this time. However, Rod Sanford told me we’d be receiving a $5 discount each time you visited us because we have arranged for you to clean our other location just off 1 of Hwy. 26. He said that this new price would be starting in February. I have included a copy of the e-mail Rod Sanford sent me. Could you please adjust the price to reflect the new agreement and send US a new bill? I’d appreciate it. We look forward to seeing you  again. <br><br>Thank you for your assistance, <br><br>Patricia Collins<br>Manager <br>Randall Auto Body",

I have taken a look at your invoice from your last bill from Express Corp. and I believe that we can beat their prices.

I know this was an area of stress for you in the fourth quarter of last year, so I wanted to give you plenty of advanced warning. You will need to bring your numbers up significantly if you want to pass the review.

I will get on them right away. I don&#39;t know why my sales are slumping so much lately in the technologies division. It seems like every sales technique 1 learned in school isn&#39;t working anymore. I am thinking about changing industries if I don&#39;t pass our review when it comes out in March. My sister is opening a beauty parlor and she was asking me to become a barber. Imagine that! Anyway, thank you again for the notice about the possible layoffs coming up.

        "text": "<h4 align =\"center\">  Respite for Commuters</h4> A new ride-sharing app in gaining in popularity as bus and taxi fees continue to rise and commuters continue to look for more efficient routers. Jordan Mills, a small business owner who commutes into downtown from his home in Brentwood has to transfer buses twice, then, take the subway to get to his workplace. Not only did he find the commute quite costly and uncomfortable in the rush-hour crowds, he found it time- consuming. But with the availability of the new app Freewheel, he found that he saved time and money with a quick ride available within 5 minutes of flagging for a ride from any location he was at. “This is definitely the future of transportation,” said Jordan. “I can’t get to work and back any other way now”.  <br>Jordan Mills isn't the only commuter who feels this way. An estimated 2000 new commuters in the city of Sherwood alone are expected to use the ride-sharing app within the next year and almost 500 new drivers have signed up to the program. <br>Freewheel is available for download at the Freewheel website and at Miniapp.com and Amacom.com. <br><br>===========================<br><br><p align =\"center\">  www.freewheel.com/history </p> <br>The idea for Freewheel began when Michael Owens and his co-workers first started a carpooling program at the company they worked at. Owens had to transfer the subway three times and the bus twice to get to work and although he could drive, the parking was limited. Fie managed the group by assigning different drivers and mapped out routes to each co-worker’s homes. Fie created an app that everyone could connect and communicate through so that the designated drivers and passengers could easily find each other. Five years later, Freewheel is now a major company with tens of thousands of users, both drivers and commuters around the country. <br>Freewheel is dedicated to keeping the cost of commuting down and the efficiency up. In time, it hopes to bring its services to people around the world. <br> <br> =============================== <br> <br><h4 align =\"center\">  Technology Initiatives </h4><p align =\"center\">  is proud to present the </p><p align =\"center\">  New Innovation Award to: </p><p align =\"center\">  Michael Owens, CEO of Freewheel</p> <br>This award recognizes the innovation and creativity of new talent in the technology industry.
