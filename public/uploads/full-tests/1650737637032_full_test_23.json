Enthusiastically Implements Deluxident’s Newest Product</b><br>OTTAWA (10 June)—Babson Vehicles Ltd., a leading Canadian manufacturer, has just adopted a new fingerprint entry System aimed at improving company security. Created by Icelandic firm Deluxident, the System enables employees to enter campus buildings simply by scanning their fingerprints.<br>According to Babson’s CEO Daniel Deems, Deluxident’s fingerprint-scanning System is a significant improvement over other security Products the company has tried in the past.<br>“Deluxident’s fingerprint scanner has been a tremendous asset. In the past, we always accessed our buildings by using photographic and electronic identification badges,” said Deems. “Producing and replacing lost badges, however, was expensive. In addition, they posed a significant security threat. Employees sometimes forgot their badges, adding to traffic through our security office. All in all, the badges were costly and risky.”<br>For the past decade, Deluxident has been offering high-tech workplace Solutions with its innovative digital Products. Headquartered in Reykjavik, Deluxident delivers items worldwide and offers 24'hour technical assitance by telephone.

I would like to know if you would be interested in selling it.<br>I have been planning to open a café in the area, and I believe that with some modest improvements, your building could be the perfect location. I would want to keep as much of the original structure intact as possible. — [2] —. Any modifications would be minor.<br>I realize there are other buildings for sale in the business district, but they do not have the same connection to the community. — [3] —, I have spoken with many Helena residents who have fond memories of your building, and they would like to see it transformed into a usable structure again. — [4] —[ I am confident that my plan would be welcomed by the community.<br>Thank you for considering my offer. If you would like to discuss details, I can be reached at 406-555-0181.<br>Sincerely,<br>Marias Cleary",

Everyone has had to wait to print documents at some point. Some of us have had to start coming to work earlier, and others are staying late.This is having a negative impact on our productivity and morale.<br>We could improve the situation for the remainder of the year by posting a sign-up sheet next to the printers. To be fair, each employee should sign up for only two fifteen-minute blocks per day. We could also reserve the lunch hour for unscheduled printing. And we should consider discontinuing the use of color printers until the situation is under control—color printing is up to five times as expensive as black-and-white printing. Let me know what you think.Regards,<br>Darius Jackson<br>Legal Administrator, Reeder and Kelter, Inc.<br><br><br> <table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"width:638px;\"><strong>MEMO</strong><br />To:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All Reeder and Kelter, Inc., Staff<br />From: Kyung-Jin Sohn, Support Manager<br />Date:&nbsp; November 24<br />Subject: &nbsp;Printer use<br />&nbsp;<br />We have purchased two new printers, a multicolor UX212 and a black-and-white UY120 Truzynx. Unfortunately, they will not be arriving until December 18. In the meantime, please continue to schedule your printer-use times using the online link I e-mailed you on November 10. Using this document, you may reserve up to two fifteen-minute printing periods per day. Please do not schedule consecutive sessions, and remember that we have set aside time both in the morning and in the afternoon for emergency printing. Also, please use the color printers only when absolutely necessary. We have been purchasing more color ink than usual because staff members are using the color printers for scanning and printing when the black-and-white printers are in use.</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><b>To</b>:  kjsohn@reederandelter.com<br><b>From</b>: Isullivan@truzynx.com<br><b>Date</b>: December 22<br><b>Subject:</b> Truzynx purchase<br>Dear Ms. Sohn,<br>Thank you for your recent purchase of two Truzynx printers for your company. Your purchase includes two years of free maintenance for each machine. Your first regularly scheduled servicing date will be one month from delivery. We also offer discounted prices on our extended maintenance plans within 60 days of equipment purchase. Please let me know if you are interested in these plans for your new printers.<br>Are you looking to improve your efficiency? We also have Truzplan. With this affordable remote-printing service, we can securely print your scanned documents and bring them to your office when you need them. Please let me know if you would like more information.<br>Sincerely,<br>Leilani Sullivan <br>Sales Representative",
