Critics of the IRI are most concerned that it will be paid for by raising local taxes. This will leave residents like me with less money for food, clothing, and toiletries, which, in turn, will mean less revenue for businesses in the area. It may also encourage high-income earners to leave Norview City or spend their disposable income elsewhere. Any gains made by higher taxation would be offset by corresponding losses. The city government should look into other options to fund the project.<br />\r\n................................................................\r\n\r\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Happy Days for Norview City Council</strong></div>\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n(22 July) - This week brought some welcome news for the Norview City Council. Just a few months ago, the council&#39;s proposed Infrastructure Redevelopment Initiative seemed unlikely to succeed; a poll released on 14 April by the Centre for Civic Engagement (CCE) revealed that just 19 percent of respondents backed the plan, since then, the council has held a series of public hearings, and a number of adjustments have been made to the proposal.<br />\r\nA CCE poll released earlier this week shows that now 52 percent of respondents are willing to fund the programme by paying 0.5 percent more in taxes. Two more public hearings on the IRI have been scheduled.<br />\r\nThe first will be held next Wednesday, 27 July, at 7:00 P.M. at the Norview City Community Centre<br />\r\nManami Ishada, Norview City.<br />\r\n&nbsp;",
