        "explanation": "<b>Transcript</b><br> M-Cn Congratulations on your new position as video director! I was surprised to hear about that position. 59Since we're an art supply store, I didn't realize we needed a video director.<br>W-Br Thanks. I know; it's a bit of an unusual position, isn't it? But with Internet shopping becoming more popular, stores really need to have a large Internet presence. 60 I'll be in charge of creating how-to videos that'll be posted online.<br>M-Cn That makes sense. And it sounds very interesting! What's your current project?<br>W-Br Well, we've just filmed the first video on how to make your own beaded necklace. It's on our Web site. Actually... 61could you tell me what you think of it?"

I see we were charged $95 dollars for each time you serviced our offices. This is what we had initially agreed upon and have been paying for your services since last j year at this time. However, Rod Sanford told me we’d be receiving a $5 discount each time you visited us because we have arranged for you to clean our other location just off 1 of Hwy. 26. He said that this new price would be starting in February. I have included a copy of the e-mail Rod Sanford sent me. Could you please adjust the price to reflect the new agreement and send US a new bill? I’d appreciate it. We look forward to seeing you  again. <br><br>Thank you for your assistance, <br><br>Patricia Collins<br>Manager <br>Randall Auto Body",
