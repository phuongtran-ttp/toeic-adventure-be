Thanks a lot for agreeing to water my plants and get the mail at my jewelry store while I’m in Singapore. 95This is my first buying trip, and I’m excited about finding new materials for my jewelry. I left the keys in an envelope under your door. 96The key to my store is the longest one with the square top, and the smallest one is for the mailbox. 97I e-mailed instructions about caring for each of the plants. Don’t worry, though – I only have a few. Thanks again for your help, and see you next week. <br>"

More and more of them are being asked to wait a week or longer for service from a repair crew. It seems that our customer base has expanded more quickly than projected, and technical support requests have increased by about 30 percent. This means that the number of technicians available to assist customers is now insuffcient.<bR><bR>The committee feels an expansion of the repair team is necessary to restore customer satisfaction. We are expecting even more customers to have our equipment installed in their homes, and with the present number of technical crews, we may not be able to handle their service needs. The committee has authorized you to recruit five more people who have the appropriate training.<bR><br>Best regards,<br>Adelina Viera, Personnel Director<br> E-last Internet, Inc.",

I know of no other non-profit organization that performs such a vital service for all-natural agriculture as yours does, and I am enthusiastic about the prospect of the Crocket Center working with Integral Harvest. <br><br>As you know, the Crockett Center has recently turned its attention to urban gardening. On this front, the main priorities are to expand existing community gardens in Austin and to found new ones in neighborhoods currently lacking them. Therefore, I would like to proceed with the gardening classes we discussed in our meeting, to be taught on-site by Integral Harvest representatives and attended by Austin community residents. If you will let me know your representatives' availability for teaching the classes and also the range of topics they will cover, I can prepare a class schedule and generate interest in it among residents. My assistant, Cindy Reed, will call you shortly for this information. <br><br>As for your proposal that Integral Harvest representatives demonstrate organic gardening to elementary school students here in Austin, since our meeting I have spoken with several school administrators. It seems that a number of the schools have gardening clubs, so students and teachers alike should make a receptive audience. Let us discuss this proposal further in our next meeting, which Ms. Reed will schedule. <br><br>I am sure that, if our two organizations work together, we can do much to promote urban gardening as a rewarding and healthful endeavor. <br><br>Yours sincerely, <br><br>Letitia Price, Executive Director<br>Crockett Center for Community Development",

By following a few important guidelines, you can ensure that your photographs last a lifetime. <br><br>If photographs are to be displayed, make sure they are placed in frames that have ultraviolet-resistant glass. Exposure to the Sun’s ultraviolet rays can cause colors to fade and can cause black-and-white photographs to turn yellow. In addition, they should be placed in frames that allow space between the glass and the top surface of the photograph. The surface of the photograph can deteriorate if it is in constant contact with glass. <br><br>When storing photographs in albums, make sure the albums contain acid-free paper. Colored paper or magnetic pages should never be used. To store photographs in boxes, use boxes made of metal or acid-free cardboard. Store albums and boxes in a dry environment, as humidity can quickly destroy photographs. <br><br>Finally, be careful when <u>handling</u> photographs, especially historic ones. If you must touch a photograph, your hands should be clean. Skin naturally produces oil, which can be harmful to photographs. You should pick up photographs only by the edges  and should wear clean cotton gloves.",

I know this was an area of stress for you in the fourth quarter of last year, so I wanted to give you plenty of advanced warning. You will need to bring your numbers up significantly if you want to pass the review. As you know, we have been struggling to make our sales goals over the past several years, and I am afraid Mr. Jones is determined to trim the staff if things don&#39;t change. I have far exceeded my target numbers, so I have included an attachment with some possible leads for sales.

I will get on them right away. I don&#39;t know why my sales are slumping so much lately in the technologies division. It seems like every sales technique 1 learned in school isn&#39;t working anymore. I am thinking about changing industries if I don&#39;t pass our review when it comes out in March. My sister is opening a beauty parlor and she was asking me to become a barber. Imagine that! Anyway, thank you again for the notice about the possible layoffs coming up. I will try to get my numbers up to standards, but I think that Mr. Jones may have already decided to let me go.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAll the best,<br />\r\nAaron<br />\r\n<br />\r\n===========================<br />\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Possible Sales Leads for January</strong></div>\r\n\r\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse\" >\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr bgcolor=\"lavender\">\r\n\t\t\t<td align=\"center\"><b>Name </b></td>\r\n\t\t\t<td align=\"center\"><b>Division </b></td>\r\n\t\t\t<td align=\"center\"><b>Account Potential </b></td>\r\n\t\t\t<td align=\"center\"><b>Rating </b></td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td align=\"center\">Sally Jones</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Technologies</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td align=\"center\">$35,000-$50,000</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td align=\"center\">Silver</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td align=\"center\">Bod Knuddle</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Technologies</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td align=\"center\">$100,000 and up</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td align=\"center\">Gold</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td align=\"center\">Marquise Lee</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Technologies</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td align=\"center\">$12,000-$20,000</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td align=\"center\">Bronze/Silver</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</adonald@acemail.com></holtrain@zipnet.net></holtrain@zipnet.net></adonald@acemail.com>",

I would be happy to pass your request for overdraft relief on to our fraud department, but you will need to file a police report and then send us the case number that the investigating officer gives you.

With over 3 million members nationwide, our franchise has become known as a reputable and trustworthy brand. Our success is a result of great relationships between US the franchiser and our franchisees.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou are receiving this mailing because you expressed interest in partnering with 24/7 Fitness in order to open a new location in your town. According to our preliminary research, your town has a large population of young, single people working in the professional field. This is our target demographic, and it means the business outlook for your 24/7 Fitness location is positive in your town. If you would like more information about the specific terms and regulations when partnering with 24/7 Fitness, please don&#39;t hesitate to call me at 347-555-3363. Additionally, if you would like to talk to another franchise owner, that information can be supplied by one of our associates.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSincerely,<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLori Swanson<br />\r\nChief Operating Officer<br />\r\n<br />\r\n==========================<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em>To: Zack Carter - zcarter@zenmail.com<br />\r\nFrom: John Morris - jmorris@cbnet.com<br />\r\nSubject: 24/7 Fitness<br />\r\nDate: March 6</em><br />\r\n<br />\r\nDear Mr. Carter,<br />\r\nMy name is John Morris and I am a small business owner living in the Millville area. I am currently in negotiations with 24/7 Fitness to open my own location here in Millville. As someone who works with 24/7 Fitness, you would help me a lot by sharing your opinions.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI am interested in how you assess 24/7 Fitness as a franchiser. I operated several franchises in the past, and I always found that trust and honesty are the most important factors in a successful relationship. More importantly, I was also wondering what kind of support is provided by the parent company. Before opening your location, did you receive adequate training to allow you to smoothly begin operating your business? Any advice you can give me would be much appreciated.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSincerely,<br />\r\nJohn Morris<br />\r\n<br />\r\n===========================<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em>To: John Morris&nbsp; - jmorris@cbnet.com<br />\r\nFrom: Zack Carter - zcarter@zenmail.com<br />\r\nSubject: 24/7 Fitness<br />\r\nDate: March 7</em><br />\r\n<br />\r\nDear Mr. Morris,<br />\r\nI am happy to provide some insight into the operation of a 24/7 Fitness franchise. I have been working with 24/7 Fitness as a franchise owner for 10 years now. I actually run three different branches now. I completely agree with you that trust and honesty are the two most important aspects of any business relationship. On that count, I believe the fact that I own three franchises is testament to my faith in the franchiser.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLet me put your mind at ease. First off, 24/7 Fitness has a very specific way that they want their brand to develop no matter who owns the branch. The parent company will not only provide training, but they insist on controlling the actual layout of the facilities from the locker rooms to the free weights. They want any of their 3 million members to be able to walk into any one of their gyms and feel at home. Until you have been operating for one full year, you must make monthly reports to corporate headquarters detailing all aspects of sales, membership, and a flow chart describing the usage of the facilities. It really is hands on until they have confidence you can represent the brand. I hope this helps you decide to join the 24/7 Fitness team!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAll the best,<br />\r\nZack Carter",
