I’m with the electrical contractors at the former Millway train station site now. The electrical system was in worse shape than we had originally thought. The rewiring and upgrades are going to cost more than expected because we want to modernize while still retaining the historical integrity of the building.I’ll send over the estimate as soon as I receive it. I’m hoping that all the work will be completed so that we can open as planned in May.<br>======================================<br><b>New Hotel to Open in South Wales</b><br> CARDIFF (18 April)—The Millway Road Hotel is scheduled to open on 14 May. The building  was once a busy train station that was designed by Arthur Lewison over 150 years ago.<br> For almost three decades the building had been left unoccupied. It was purchased two years ago by Steffan Griffiths, president of Griffiths Hoteliers.<br>According to project coordinator Fausto Forletti, the old building required extensive renovation not only to turn it into a hotel but also to update the electrical, heating, and plumbing systems.<br> The hotel has 25 guest rooms, a meeting room, and a restaurant with banquet facilities. All of Mr. Griffths' facilities are noted for their world-class dining experiences. The hotel’s Bayside Cafe has award-winning Welsh chef Mal Davies to create a menu and oversee the restaurant.<br> In the near future, Mr. Griffiths plans to expand the property’s garden. For information and reservations, visit www.millwayroadhotel.co.uk. <br>======================================<br>✩✩✩✩<br><b>Millway Road Hotel</b><br>Review posted by Mi-Yeon Ko<br>I recently attended a small conference at the Millway Road Hotel, which opened in June. As a computer technician, I was pleasantly surprised to find that it had such up-to-date facilities. Both my room and the meeting room had more than enough electrical outlets to plug-in equipment and charge mobile phones and computers. The complimentary wireless internet service was easy to access. On top of that, the food was delicious and the guest rooms were beautiful",

I have heard from some friends that your parties are absolutely the best. I really want to make a good impression with my sister's new in-laws; it will be the first time that they join our family for our annual reunion. I just have a few questions for you. First, I need to know how much you would charge for a party for 25 people. I can afford $25 per person, not including alcohol. My family is also a little bit picky with the food they like, so if it is possible for you to send a list of the foods that you provide and the cost per person, I would like to go through it and create my own menu. The last question I have for you is staffing. I really don't want to be cleaning up and doing dishes during the party. Do you provide staff, and if so, how much do you charge for their service? Please write me back so we can get this party planned!<br>All the best, Leroy Jenkins<br>===========================<br>To:Leroy Jenkins - ljenkins@smope.com<br>From:Jason Roberts - jroberts@robertsparties.com <br>Date:Sept. 25<br>Subject:Fall Party<br><br>Dear Mr. Jenkins,<br>So glad to hear that our parties have been such a success. We do have a catering menu for you to choose items from, and feel free to mix and match based on your own budget and tastes. I have included a menu as well as a staffing guide. I recommend hiring the Banquet Captain if you have nerves about the event. Our Banquet Captains are trained to engage and charm the guests at the parties we host, hence our strong reputation.<br>I look forward to making your party a success!<br>Jason Roberts<br>===========================<br>@PS@/onthisinhvien.appspot.com/images/3573701_1592552435835.png@PE@<br>===========================",

According to our account data, we see that you did contact us and freeze your accounts, though it looks like it was too late to prevent the withdrawal and subsequent overdraft of your account. It is a little bit unusual that the transaction that caused the overdraft was at an ATM machine a day after you say that you lost your card. Have you given your access pin to anybody recently? I would be happy to pass your request for overdraft relief on to our fraud department, but you will need to file a police report and then send us the case number that the investigating officer gives you. Once we receive this number, we can proceed with our review of your case.<br />\r\nThank you and good day,<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLaura Massey,<br />\r\nCustomer Service Specialist, Stark Bank /customerservice@starkbank.com / ssummers@zippynet.com / ssummers@zippynet.com / customerservice@starkbank.com",
