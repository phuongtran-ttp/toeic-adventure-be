I’ve read that letting staff work in an open space instead of in individual cubicles promotes collaboration and creativity.<br>M-Cn Well, 45the survey results show that the main problem is noise. Employees say they're distracted by people having work conversations in open spaces.<br>W-Br 43Maybe we should send out a memo reminding people about our policy to use meeting rooms for work-related discussions.<br>M-Cn Good idea I'II do that right away."

Kimberly Lee, host of the My Home Cooking television show and owner of her own restaurant chain, seems to know all the secrets. Her show has been on the air for over two years, and now she has a devoted group of followers around the country. When she sat down for an interview with US, she said that fresh vegetables and local produce are the key to cooking healthy and tasty food. <br>Ms. Lee is scheduled to publish her very first cookbook near the end of the month. The book is entitled Kimberly Lee’s My Home Cooking, and it provides easy-to- follow recipes that can be made in less than 30 minutes. Over 40,000 copies have already been pre-ordered so far. <br>Ms. Lee says that the final page of the book will include a detachable fan club membership form. Those who fill the form out and send it in to the provided address will receive a monthly newsletter and exclusive recipes available only to those in the fan club. Fan club members will also receive a password that allows access to a fan club website. <br><br>===========================<br><br>To: Kimberly Lee-kimberlylee@kimberlylee.com<br>From: Suzie Sanders - suziesanders@kimberlylee.com<br>Date: October 12<br>Subject: Update<br><br>Dear Ms. Lee, <br>Great news! I’m happy to report that not only has your book been selling well, but the number of new members joining the fan club has been increasing drastically since it was published. I’m certain that the article in the newspaper helped generate considerable publicity for your book. <br>Also, we have received a lot of feedback from new members expressing a desire for more recipes for cakes, cookies, and candies to be featured in next month’s newsletter. I think it would be a good idea to meet their needs this time. <br>Sincerely, <br><br>Suzie Sanders Publicity <br>Coordinator",

I am majoring in industrial engineering here, and my liquid dynamics professor, Dr. Alcobar, recommended Master stroke Industries as a possible internship opportunity. Your company is recognized as a leader in flow research. If you would be willing to accept an intern for the coming spring semester, I could give you up to 15 hours per week of work, provided that you are able to write some performance evaluations that I could turn in to Dr. Alcobar for credit. Thank you for your consideration, and if you would like to see my transcript, I would be happy to forward it to you. <br>All the best, Carl Ennens<br><br>==========================<br><br> To: Carl Ennens (cennens@gmail.com)<br>From: John Masterson (jmasterson@masterstrokeindustries.com)<br> Date: December 31<br>Subject: Internship <br> <br>Dear Carl Ennens, <br>I appreciate your interest in interning with US here at Master Stroke Industries. We have not accepted a lot of interns in the past, but I know Dr. Alcobar personally, and if he recommended that you contact US, he must have faith in your ability. I think we should set up an interview at our headquarters downtown on Holly street. We can get to know each other a bit over some coffee and I will show you around our facilities. Don't worry about your transcripts; like I said, if Dr. Alcobar thinks you’ll be a good fit, I’ll trust his judgment. How about this coming Friday at 10 A.M.? <br><br>Look forward to meeting you Carl, <br>John Masterson<br>CEO, Master stroke Industries<br><br>==========================<br><br><h4 align =\"center\"> Memorandum To Master stroke Industry Employees </h4><br>This spring, at Master stroke Industries, we will have an intern assisting US with everything from making coffee to solving complex equations. Carl Ennens is a student here at the University and has kindly offered his services in exchange for a piece of our operational knowledge. Please treat him with respect and don’t be afraid to use him for an extra pair of hands, eyes, or opinion should you need it. And I did hear he makes a good cup of coffee!",

        "text": "Attention Loyal Green Brew Customer! <br>Green Brew Cafe is redesigning our loyalty program - it's not just for coffee anymore! As a frequent customer, you're invited to participate in testing the new program. Interested? Go to greenbrew.com to read more and download the new Green Brew app. Then start accumulating points by enjoying our sandwiches, smoothies, and salads in addition to your favorite coffee drinks. When you post a review on our Web site, you will receive twenty extra points as a thank-you gift! <br><br>==========================<br><br>FinnD188 (8 July): Why is Green Brew changing its loyalty program? With the new program, the points system has changed. I have to buy twice as many coffee drinks to get a free one now. I like using the mobile app to pay, but I don't like the points. I think the program needs some rethinking before its official launch. <br>Alannah08 (14 July): Berthe's Beanery still has a punch card to earn free drinks - much simpler than this new system Green Brew is testing. I'll keep going to Green Brew as long as I can keep using my punch card, but when the new program replaces the old one completely, I'll probably go to Bertha's more often. <br>CoffeeBea (29 July): I was excited about the app, and it does make paying for purchases very easy. But it's much easier to earn drinks at other nearby cafe, and that's more important to me. I think Green Brew needs to make some changes before introducing the new system. <br><br>==========================<br><br><strong>A lesson in Loyalty</strong><br /><strong>By Hudson Aird</strong><br /><strong>27 August</strong><br />Maintaing customer loyalty can be difficult. Just ask Green Brew Cafe owner Taylah Carver. She recently began experimenting with a change to the cafe loyalty program to reward her regular customers. Instead of the old punch-card system, which rewarded customers for coffee purchases only, the new program allows customers to earn points for buying food items as well. The points are tracked through the Green Brew app, which customers download to their mobile devices. The app can also be used to pay for orders.<br />The program was originally scheduled to be introduced to the general public in September, but after nearly 60 customers tried out the app for a month, Carver decided to defer the launch. Most users liked the fact that the app allows them to pay using their mobile devices, but there were many complaints about the new points system. It now takes twice as many purchases before customers accumulate enough points to be eligible for a free coffee drink, and that was too much, reviewers said. The lesson, says Ms. Carver: know your customers",
