        "text": "<br><b>Beneath  the Bright Blue Sea</b><br>(2 November)—If you are looking for advanced underwater cameras. To deal Sara Nannup, start by checking under the sea. That’s where she has captured all the images in her latest book of photography, Beneath the Bright Blue Sea.<br>Ms. Nannup began taking pictures when her father gave her an easy-to-use instant camera for her fifth birthday. When she went to university, however, she put the camera down to pursue a career in print journalism.<br>After she graduated, Ms. Nannup was hired as a staff writer by the Perth Daily Tribune and had little time for taking pictures. That changed when she attended an underwater photography workshop while on vacation in Bali, Indonesia.There her interest in photography was renewed, and she eventually left her job at the newspaper to devote herself to photography full-time.<br>Although she started with a child’s instant camera, Ms. Nannup now works with advanced underwater cameras. To deal with wear and tear, she updates her equipment every few years. “Salt water and sand pose challenges for underwater photography equipment beyond those that an everyday camera would face,” she said.<br> After years now of diving and taking pictures, she has yet to tire of her profession. “I still love being able to show people images of creatures and places that they have never seen,” says Ms. Nannup.<br>Most of Ms. Nannup’s work, including her latest release, focuses on the ocean around Australia. In May, however, she will travel to Greece to photograph underwater ruins in the Mediterranean for her next book.<br>Visit www.saranannup.com.au for more information on Ms. Nannup and her work.",

        "text": "<br />\r\nKELOWNA (2 June)&mdash;A new enterprise is revolutionizing mealtime in Kelowna. Fine Fresh Foods is a meal-delivery service that was founded one year ago by Kathryn Mishra. The service allows users to go online and browse hundreds of recipes. They select the recipes they like and have the ingredients, with cooking instructionsshipped to them on a weekly basis. Ms. Mishra first thought of the idea she observed her friends&rsquo; hectic lives. &ldquo;My friends were too busy to plan, shop, and cook for themselves,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;Most nights they would go to a restaurant and get takeout food. Some wanted to cook at home in their kitchens but didn&rsquo;t feel confident in their abilities.&rdquo; Ms. Mishra has found a way to streamline the whole process. Fine Fresh Foods works with local suppliers&mdash;often small farms&mdash;that are required to be organic. The focus on working with local partners, as well as the convenience and reasonable price of the service, has made the business extremely popular. At the moment, Fine when Fresh Foods delivers only within Kelowna but expansion to other areas is planned in the coming year.<br />\r\n<strong>=========================</strong>\r\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width:638px;\">Pennington Farm is teaming up with Fine Fresh Foods!
