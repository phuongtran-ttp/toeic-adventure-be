His company is responsible for funding our latest work, building wells in Africa. <b> The value of his contributions can be seen on the walls of his office, which are lined with pictures of the villages he has provided with clean drinking water</b>. In the last year, Broadbank Industries has donated over 12 million dollars and built over 3000 wells across the poorest regions of Africa. This has grown into Mr. Hardwell’s greatest passion, and <b> he now spends about six months of each year in Africa overseeing his workers and ensuring his money is being spent in the right places.  think it’s safe to say that Mr. Hardwell should leave some room on his walls</b>. In the next year, he intends to increase well production by 10 percent. He has written a book about his experiences titled Water is Life: Giving Back to the World. <b> Today he will preview the book and show US some video footage of the work he is doing in Africa</b>. Please put your hands together for Mr. Hardwell."

As you know, this meeting is a great opportunity for US to assess our operating plan and to make any adjustments that might help US keep up with constant changes in the marketplace. As an advertising agency, it&rsquo;s crucial we stay informed about the newest market trends. Therefore, I was excited when I heard that Tsuyoshi Ito, manager of our Japanese branch, would be visiting this Friday. In order to take advantage of his expertise and knowledge, I would like to change the meeting date so that Mr. Ito can attend.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis will be Mr. Ito&rsquo;s first time in the country, so I would like you to pick him up from the airport. A company car will be provided to you for this purpose. I will e-mail again once I have more details concerning Mr. Ito&rsquo;s arrival time.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSincerely,<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSam Miller<br />\r\nPresident<br />\r\nMiller Advertising",

Employees who wish to participate will leave work at lunchtime, yet will still be paid as if they had worked a full day. Volunteers are asked to bring supplies such as protective outerwear, tools, insect repellent, trash bags, and snacks.<br />\r\nA shuttle bus will depart from the company parking lot at 1:20 P.M. on Friday to take volunteers to the volunteer location. If you have a specific preference concerning the type of work you would like to do, please contact Event Organizer Don Lewis at 435- 555-6768.<br />\r\nWe appreciate everyone&rsquo;s enthusiasm and support.<br />\r\nFred Hanes<br />\r\nHuman Resources, Joint Systems",

Learning about different kinds of loans will help you make an informed decision. Review the loan choices below and decide which loan is right for your situation.<br />\r\n<b><u>Fixed-Rate Mortgage Loan</u></b> - This loan ensures that your interest rate and monthly principal repayment remain the same during the entire period of your loan. This loan protects you from rising interest rates and may be a good choice if you plan to live in your home for a long time.<br />\r\n<b><u>Adjustable-Rate Mortgage Loan</u></b><u> </u> - Your interest rate remains fixed for the initial 5 years, and then is adjusted annually. Typically, this loan has a lower initial interest rate than on a fixed- rate mortgage.<br />\r\n<b><u>Interest-Only Mortgage Loan</u></b><u> </u> - During the initial 5 years of the loan, you are required to make payments on interest only. This option is suitable for those with fluctuating incomes. When your finances are tight, you can make the interest-only payment. And when your earnings increase, you can make payments on principal.<br />\r\n<b><u>Home Opportunity Loan </u></b><u> </u> -This special loan is designed for first-time home buyers. You do not need a large down payment and a perfect credit rating in order to qualify for this loan.",

I also added some helpful information to the end of the advertisement. Please let me know if the design and new additions meet your expectations. Along with the concurrent television ad, I think this advertisement will help bring a lot of new customers to Endless Acres Golf Club. <br>Sincerely, <br>Henry Choi<br><br>========================== <br><br><h4 align =\"center\"> Endless Acres Golf Club </h4><p align =\"center\">1232 Hilly Meadows Drive, Mapleview, CO</p>Take a break from all the stress of life and play a round of relaxing golf at Endless Acres Golf Club. After a game of golf, enjoy a meal at our restaurant in a sophisticated and welcoming environment. <br>We are currently offering the following promotion: <br>Reserve a tee time for a party of seven or more golfers and receive 20% off. Additionally, every member of your group will receive a coupon for $5 off any purchase from our golf shop. <br>We were recently praised by The Rolling Meadows Daily for the superb maintenance of our golf course and grounds. Come in and enjoy the best golf course in the state of Colorado. We are located off exit 21 on Highway 5. Just look for our billboard. You can't miss it! <br>Reservations can now be made online at our website at www.endlessacresgolf. com or by calling 555-4834. <br><br>===========================<br><br>From: Logan Mankins - lmankins@crushing.com <br>To: reservations@endlessacresgolfclub.com<br>Date: July 6<br>Subject: Re: Tee Time and Dinner for 10<br><br>Hello, <br>I saw your ad in the newspaper and I have a couple quick questions about your deals. First, we have a group of ten golfers. Now I know most courses generally limit a group to four players to keep up the pace of play, but I was really hoping you could make an exception for us and allow two groups of five. We will even rent golf carts to ensure that we don’t cause a delay. As for the $5 gift cards to the pro shop, I was wondering if they could be pooled together for one large purchase. It is my son’s birthday and I would like to buy him a new putter and they are awfully expensive these days. $50 bucks could go a long way to giving him a great gift! <br>We would like to tee off around 11:30 A.M. on Saturday, July 20th, and then have dinner there at about 6:00 P.M. Please write back to confirm our tee time and answer my queries. Thank you for your time! <br>Have a great day, <br> Logan Mankins",

Your monthly membership fees help US to obtain new books, computers, journal subscriptions, and other resources that are useful to the entire community. We would like to inform you of some special upcoming events this month you may be interested in attending.<br />\r\nFirst, famous children&#39;s book author and storyteller Ebert Butler will be visiting our library. He will be reading from his new book, The Mysterious Cat, and signing autographs. His book was recently nominated for the Children&#39;s Book of the Year Award. Kathy Butler, Mr. Butler&#39;s wife, will also be in attendance at this event. She has drawn the pictures in most of Mr. Butler&#39;s books, including The Mysterious Cat. This event costs $10 but is provided free for library members.<br />\r\nLater in the month, renowned wildlife photographer Nina Brooks will be holding an exhibition on the main floor of the library. Ms. Brooks recently returned from a trip to Kenya, where she photographed cheetahs, giraffes, elephants, and other animals. Her photographs capture the vividness of the wildlife and the majesty of nature.<br />\r\nIn addition to these two featured events, there will be a variety of workshops, games nights, and other events this month. Check the attached calendar for details. All events, including Movie Night, are free unless noted otherwise.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSincerely,<br />\r\nHolly Allen<br />\r\nLibrary Events Coordinator<br />\r\n<br />\r\n==============================<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Clayton Library Events Calendar<br />\r\nAugust</strong><br />\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse\">\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td><b>Date/Time </b></td>\r\n\t\t\t<td><b>Event Title</b></td>\r\n\t\t\t<td><b>Notes </b></td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Saturday, Aug. 2, 5:00 P.M.</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Creative Writers Workshop</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Led by Donna Ward</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Friday, Aug. 8, 7:00 P.M.</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Movie Night</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Family-friendly event Entrance</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Sunday, Aug. 17, 6:00 PM.</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>The Mysterious Cat Reading</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Entrance cost of $10</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Wednesday, Aug. 20, 3:00 P.M.</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Knitting Club</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Complimentary refreshments</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Saturday, Aug. 30, 2:00 P.M.</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Photo Exhibition Opening</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Entrance cost of $5</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n==============================<br />\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Clayton Library Community Chat Board</b></div>\r\n<br />\r\n<em><strong>August 1<br />\r\n&gt; User ID: Jjohnson231</strong></em><br />\r\nSubject: Creative Writers Workshop August 2<br />\r\nHey, is anybody going to go to the writers workshop tomorrow?

I am going for sure. You are right, Donna is the best. Her knowledge of narrative and pacing have really helped me with my screenplay. Maybe I could read through your short story after the workshop and give you my feedback too? The more eyes the better, I always say! I&#39;ll let you take a look through my screenplay too if you are interested. See you tomorrow! -Chuck- /hollyallen@claytonlibrary.edu/members@claytonlibrary.edu",
