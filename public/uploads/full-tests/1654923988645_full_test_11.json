That’s more expensive than I thought it would be. Our budget was three thousand dollars. Why is the price so high? <br>M2: <b> I can explain why the price is over your budget</b>. It is because the old paint is peeling badly in some areas. We have to remove it all before repainting, which takes a long time. If you had repainted it earlier it would be less expensive. <br>M1:  In the future I would recommend painting it every 7 years. <br>W: OK. I thought I was being over charged, but that makes sense. <b>You can go ahead and begin painting on the first weekend of August.</b>"

Even so, last week's fashion show in Milan was particularly notable for the vast number of garments made partly or entirely out of silk. From eveningwear to sportswear, many designers featured colorful silks in their collections.<br><br>The designers were likely responding to a market trend: a dramatically increased demand for colorful silk products. “Our sales of silk shirts and dresses have reached an all-time high,” said Christina Alvarez, a buyer for Gatsby’s in London. “Silk items have been flying off the racks.”<br><br>Economic analysts were surprised by the trend, since they had predicted that the rise of dry-cleaning costs would take a toll on silk manufacturers. However, comfort may have been a greater factor than price, especially given the unusually hot weather this past summer. “Today’s silk garments,” said Ms. Alvarez, “are lighter and cooler than many other types of clothing.”",

In its heyday, Marion Hall was a popular downtown destination for residents to dance, enjoy live music, and watch movies. However, it has lost its popularity gradually since the multiplex building was completed on Henson Street 4 years ago. <br>After all of the necessary repairs are made on Marion Hall, city officials will strive to invite various performers including famous theater companies, musicians, comedians, and speakers to the newly renovated theater. “We hope Marion Hall can serve as a new center for culture here in Marion,” said Marion City Mayor Greg Fields. <br>The revitalization of Marion Hall is part of a larger project to enhance the public facilities in Marion. On April 29, the Marion Children’s Park, which features a baseball field as well as several playgrounds, is scheduled to have its grand reopening.",

Ideally, we would like to have our event on Saturday, December 20. I just have a few questions about your services. First, do you provide decorations? I really want this year’s party to be a hit; it is my first time being responsible for it and I really want to impress the boss. Second do you have a wide range of vegetarian dishes? We have 12 vegetarians on our staff of 35, so it will be important to provide them a full meal, not just appetizers. If you could get back to me with the answers to my questions and your availability for the 20th, I would greatly appreciate it.<br><br>Sincerely,<br>Jason. Hostrum<br>Junior Secretary, Johnson Home Furnishing<br><br>===========================<br><br>To:Jason Hostrum - jhostrum@jhfurnishing.com <br>From:Brian Petersen - bpetersen@atasteofclass.com<br>Date:November 21<br>Subject:Office Christmas Party<br><br>Dear Mr. Hostrum,<br>I am delighted that you have contacted A Taste of Class to help make your Christmas party one to remember. Let me answer all of your questions and put your mind at ease. To begin with, we have one team left that can cater you for the 20th of December, so you are in luck! As far as the decorations are concerned, we have several different themes to choose from; please visit our website at www.atasteofclass.com to see pictures of our successful events from the past. They are labeled with themes so you may just choose one that appeals to you. Your final inquiry regarding the vegetarian option will also require some decision making on your part. We offer gourmet dining and are happy to specially prepare 12 vegetarian meals, but that can be a little bit expensive. I don’t know what your budget is, but might I suggest making the entire menu vegetarian? We have an outstanding vegetarian chef, Julia Monroe, who can prepare a full vegetarian buffet so delicious a lion would eat it! This option is also a lot more cost-effective than preparing two separate menus. After reviewing your options, please let me know what choices are best for you.<br><br>Sincerely,<br>Brian Petersen,<br>Booking and Sales Manager A Taste of Class<br><br>===========================<br><br>To:Brian Petersen - bpetersen@atasteofclass.com <br>From:Jason Hostrum - jhostrum@jhfurnishing.com <br>Date:November 22<br>Subject:Office Christmas Party<br><br>Dear Mr. Petersen,<br><br>Thanks for your reply I want to go ahead and book the event for Saturday the 2Oth of December.

The much loved <em>Waking Up</em> chronicled the ups and downs Mendoza experienced as he moved from job to job as a youth, working as everything from dock worker and fisherman, to hotel clerk and tennis<br />\r\ninstructor. <em>Life Lessons in Advertising</em> picks up where the previous book left off, with Mendoza having just arrived in New York City. We follow his rise from mailroom clerk to the head of M&amp;D Creative, a highly successful advertising agency.<br />\r\nWritten in the humorous, informal style that has made Mendoza&#39;s ads so successful over the years, the book shares stories of client case histories and reveals how he developed his most successful advertisements. The book is now available online and in bookstores everywhere.<br />\r\n<br>=================\r\n<br>Book Review: Life Lessons in Advertising\r\n<br>By Julia Turnbull\r\n<br>Given that it took twenty years for David Mendoza\td\r\nto write his second book, Life Lessons in Advertising, the impression the reader is left with at the end is that\r\nhe forgot to edit his work. While 1 thoroughly enjoyed Mendoza’s previous book, this sequel is made up of dull, complicated sentences that make reading a chore. There’s no argument regarding his abilities as an advertising executive, yet the anecdotes about life in the advertising business arc so much less engaging than those earlier stories that almost jumped off the pages. For example, nothing matches the earlier book’s crystal clear descriptions of his escapades and unexpected adventures as a hotel clerk in northern Montana. This is one book you can skip. \r\n\r\n<br>=================\r\n\r\n<i><br>Advertising in Motion Magazine\r\n<br>A minute with...\r\n<br>Advertising guru David Mendoza</i>\r\n<br><br><b>AIMM:</b>\tWhy did it take you so long to write this book?\r\n<br><b>Mendoza:</b> It's funny. I've always considered my copywriting to be my strength. But long pieces of writing, like manuscripts, are very difficult for me, so 1 take my time to edit them carefully. But I'm very proud of the end result-—it's easy to read and highly enjoyable, just like my first book.\r\n<br><b>AIMM:</b> You've held so many jobs, like fisherman and tennis instructor. Why do you think advertising stuck?\r\n<br><b>Mendoza:</b> I'm not so sure it did really stick, although I've been with it for a while. My philosophy is to be open to any opportunity that comes my way. Advertising came my way, but I'm rather sure it's not the last thing I'll try my hand at And you never know, 1 might go back to fishing or tennis.",
