While most buses stop running by 1:00 A.M., some parts of downtown will see buses running all night. The Bingham shopping district will also see buses running until 3:00 A.M. “This is when we have the most tourists and out-of-town folks coming to visit,” explained Mayor Bill Nate. “We felt it was important to provide the necessary services during this time.” - [3] - When the bus drivers’ union leader, Nathan Reiner, was asked about the new schedules he responded, \"We worked out a payment that is agreeable on both sides and have enough drivers that can work in shifts so that there is no danger of overworking or exhaustion. Many of US will still get some time off during the holidays with our families.” - [4] –",

The data are in and they look good. Most people expressed satisfaction with their communication with our representatives. Their questions about packaging services, shipping charges, and the status of their parcels were answered professionally and promptly.<br>One area that we need to address is the low number of referrals. Few customers we approached reported telling others about our services. Based on the answers, most people are repeat customers  who always rely on us  for their shipping needs, or they choose us based on our advertising.  Clearly, we fail to request referrals properly.<br>Therefore, our meeting next Friday will center around  this  topic.  I  will  design materials and practice activities to correct this shortcoming.  But  I would also appreciate it if you could come up with some creative ways to improve our referral rate. Send me your suggestions and I will be sure to include them in our discussion. I look forward to hearing from you all.<br>Janice Wells, <br>Senior Customer Service Coordinator",

With over 3 million members nationwide, our franchise has become known as a reputable and trustworthy brand. Our success is a result of great relationships between US the franchiser and our franchisees.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou are receiving this mailing because you expressed interest in partnering with 24/7 Fitness in order to open a new location in your town. According to our preliminary research, your town has a large population of young, single people working in the professional field. This is our target demographic, and it means the business outlook for your 24/7 Fitness location is positive in your town. If you would like more information about the specific terms and regulations when partnering with 24/7 Fitness, please don&#39;t hesitate to call me at 347-555-3363. Additionally, if you would like to talk to another franchise owner, that information can be supplied by one of our associates.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSincerely,<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLori Swanson<br />\r\nChief Operating Officer<br />\r\n<br />\r\n==========================<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em>To: Zack Carter - zcarter@zenmail.com<br />\r\nFrom: John Morris - jmorris@cbnet.com<br />\r\nSubject: 24/7 Fitness<br />\r\nDate: March 6</em><br />\r\n<br />\r\nDear Mr. Carter,<br />\r\nMy name is John Morris and I am a small business owner living in the Millville area. I am currently in negotiations with 24/7 Fitness to open my own location here in Millville. As someone who works with 24/7 Fitness, you would help me a lot by sharing your opinions.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI am interested in how you assess 24/7 Fitness as a franchiser. I operated several franchises in the past, and I always found that trust and honesty are the most important factors in a successful relationship. More importantly, I was also wondering what kind of support is provided by the parent company. Before opening your location, did you receive adequate training to allow you to smoothly begin operating your business? Any advice you can give me would be much appreciated.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSincerely,<br />\r\nJohn Morris<br />\r\n<br />\r\n===========================<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em>To: John Morris&nbsp; - jmorris@cbnet.com<br />\r\nFrom: Zack Carter - zcarter@zenmail.com<br />\r\nSubject: 24/7 Fitness<br />\r\nDate: March 7</em><br />\r\n<br />\r\nDear Mr. Morris,<br />\r\nI am happy to provide some insight into the operation of a 24/7 Fitness franchise. I have been working with 24/7 Fitness as a franchise owner for 10 years now. I actually run three different branches now. I completely agree with you that trust and honesty are the two most important aspects of any business relationship. On that count, I believe the fact that I own three franchises is testament to my faith in the franchiser.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLet me put your mind at ease. First off, 24/7 Fitness has a very specific way that they want their brand to develop no matter who owns the branch. The parent company will not only provide training, but they insist on controlling the actual layout of the facilities from the locker rooms to the free weights. They want any of their 3 million members to be able to walk into any one of their gyms and feel at home. Until you have been operating for one full year, you must make monthly reports to corporate headquarters detailing all aspects of sales, membership, and a flow chart describing the usage of the facilities. It really is hands on until they have confidence you can represent the brand. I hope this helps you decide to join the 24/7 Fitness team!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAll the best,<br />\r\nZack Carter",

        "text": "April 5&mdash;Clearwater Hospital in downtown Scranton has launched a new pen pal letter-writing program between terminally ill hospital patients and adult volunteers. Hospital Director Zack Chambers, who was recently presented with an Outstanding Leader Award from the National Health Care Alliance, started the program to create stronger connections between the hospital and the community. Mr. Chambers encourages adults of all types and occupations to apply even if they don&rsquo;t feel completely qualified. Simply visit the Clearwater Hospital website and become a member of the hospital free of charge.<br />\r\n&ldquo;I hope through this program, volunteers can form close relationships with patients to help them get through these difficult times in their lives,&rdquo; said Mr. Chambers. He also hopes that the program will lead to more people visiting terminally ill patients in person.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n==========================<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em>Clearwater Hospital<br />\r\nMay 4<br />\r\nMonica Greene<br />\r\n4100 Washington Road<br />\r\nScranton, Wisconsin 54481</em><br />\r\n<br />\r\nDear Ms. Greene,<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI was delighted to receive your letter. I am very excited to have been paired with you as pen pals. I hope we can learn a lot from each other and build a lasting friendship.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs you know, I live in California, which is a long way from Wisconsin. I hope that in the coming months I can find some time off work and visit you. Please let me know when the most convenient time would be for me to meet you.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI look forward to hearing from you,<br />\r\nJessica Wright<br />\r\n<br />\r\n===========================<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDear Jessica,<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou don&rsquo;t know how much I appreciate your kind words. Although the staff at Clearwater are very kind, I feel the need to connect with people who are not part of the staff. My surviving family also live a great distance away, in Florida, and so most of the time I am just communicating with the paid staff or the other patients. I would welcome a visit, if you truly wanted to come, and the best time would be for our meeting is the Thanksgiving holiday party here at the center I suppose. My own family might be here as well. If it is too much for you, or if you can&rsquo;t get the time off of work, don&rsquo;t worry about it too much. I do hope that we can continue to communicate through our letters.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAll the best,<br />\r\nMonica Greene",
