I previously worked as a secretary at a hospital. <b> At that time, I learned that I really enjoy working with people</b>. So I thought working in retail would be a good fit for me. <br>M: Yes, that is very important. Here at our store, we expect all employees to be kind and helpful with each and every customer. <b> Next, I’d like to ask about your availability during the week. </b>"

I think we need to reduce the amount we are spending on company lunches and dinners. <br>W: <b> Yes, I agree. I think we need to start paying for our own lunches.</b> <br>M2: I agree with both of you, but I think we need to keep entertaining clients. I think if we pay for our own lunches, then that will leave money to take clients out for dinner. <br>M1: That’s a pretty good idea Bob. Karen, does that sound OK with you? <br>W: I think that’s a great compromise Bob. <b> I will make a monthly budget plan and e-mail it to you this afternoon.</b>"

The data are in and they look good. Most people expressed satisfaction with their communication with our representatives. Their questions about packaging services, shipping charges, and the status of their parcels were answered professionally and promptly.<br>One area that we need to address is the low number of referrals. Few customers we approached reported telling others about our services. Based on the answers, most people are repeat customers  who always rely on us  for their shipping needs, or they choose us based on our advertising.  Clearly, we fail to request referrals properly.<br>Therefore, our meeting next Friday will center around  this  topic.  I  will  design materials and practice activities to correct this shortcoming.  But  I would also appreciate it if you could come up with some creative ways to improve our referral rate. Send me your suggestions and I will be sure to include them in our discussion. I look forward to hearing from you all.<br>Janice Wells, <br>Senior Customer Service Coordinator",

The number of tourists who travel in campers, motor homes, and other recreational vehicles (RVs) has increased significantly nationwide. While the proportion of visitors who arrive by RV is still small compared to more traditional tourists, I am sure you will agree that forcing RV tourists to leave every evening only compromises our efforts to promote tourism, which is connected to a substantial amount of income for our city. We are confident that making Olsenburg “RV friendly” will benefit the local tourism industry and its employees. Three nearby cities that have lifted similar bans have reported positive results. Tocasta Town, Gamma Village, and Arcoda City are evidence that welcoming RV tourists can promote tourism, generating more reverse for restaurants and local shops. Next month, Arcoda City will even begin adding special RV parking areas in its parks.<br><br>As you know, the tourism and food service industries employ over 25 percent of our workforce. Currently, however, many of our visitors are here only during the daytime, so we are losing business to neighboring cities. RV tourism would not compete with hotel tourism. In fact, it would only increase the total number of visitors to our city.<br><br>I look forward to seeing you at the meeting next Thursday, where the city council will address this important issue.<br><br>Respectfully yours,<br>Linda Defrey<br>Senior Vice President of  overnmental Affairs<br> Olsenburg Business Association",

The Service was a big time-saver because my order was ready for me when I got to the store. Since I had already paid Online, I didn&rsquo;t have to wait in the regular line in the store.<br />\r\nUnfortunately, I didn&rsquo;t double-check my order before I left the store. When I arrived at the house I was working on, I realized I had received only one of the two gallons of BN-101 paint ĩ had ordered. I called the store immediately, and the manager arranged for me to pick up the missing gallon of paint at the location closest to where I was working. Also, he gave me my money back for both gallons. I will definitely use this Service again!<br />\r\nJesse Beeby<br />\r\n===============================<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo: Jesse Beeby - jbeeby@jbeebyinc.com <br />\r\nFrom: Hattie Jones- hattie.jones@brightnowhome.com <br />\r\nDate: September 19<br />\r\nSubject: Online Order<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMr. Beeby, We are glad to have served your business recently. We saw the comments you posted about us uopine.com, and we are grateful to you. It was nice to hear that our flagship location was so convenient to your work site and that you were able to pick up your missing paint there. We stand behind our products and services and look forward to seeing you again soon. After all, the rainy season is almost here, so now is a great time to come in and get the tools you need for those upcoming roof jobs!<br />\r\nHattie Jones<br />\r\nCustomer Service Manager<br />\r\nBright Now Home./hattie.jones@brightnowhome.com/jbeeby@jbeebyinc.com",

        "text": "<h4 align =\"center\">  Respite for Commuters</h4> A new ride-sharing app in gaining in popularity as bus and taxi fees continue to rise and commuters continue to look for more efficient routers. Jordan Mills, a small business owner who commutes into downtown from his home in Brentwood has to transfer buses twice, then, take the subway to get to his workplace. Not only did he find the commute quite costly and uncomfortable in the rush-hour crowds, he found it time- consuming. But with the availability of the new app Freewheel, he found that he saved time and money with a quick ride available within 5 minutes of flagging for a ride from any location he was at. “This is definitely the future of transportation,” said Jordan. “I can’t get to work and back any other way now”.  <br>Jordan Mills isn't the only commuter who feels this way. An estimated 2000 new commuters in the city of Sherwood alone are expected to use the ride-sharing app within the next year and almost 500 new drivers have signed up to the program. <br>Freewheel is available for download at the Freewheel website and at Miniapp.com and Amacom.com. <br><br>===========================<br><br><p align =\"center\">  www.freewheel.com/history </p> <br>The idea for Freewheel began when Michael Owens and his co-workers first started a carpooling program at the company they worked at. Owens had to transfer the subway three times and the bus twice to get to work and although he could drive, the parking was limited. Fie managed the group by assigning different drivers and mapped out routes to each co-worker’s homes. Fie created an app that everyone could connect and communicate through so that the designated drivers and passengers could easily find each other. Five years later, Freewheel is now a major company with tens of thousands of users, both drivers and commuters around the country. <br>Freewheel is dedicated to keeping the cost of commuting down and the efficiency up. In time, it hopes to bring its services to people around the world. <br> <br> =============================== <br> <br><h4 align =\"center\">  Technology Initiatives </h4><p align =\"center\">  is proud to present the </p><p align =\"center\">  New Innovation Award to: </p><p align =\"center\">  Michael Owens, CEO of Freewheel</p> <br>This award recognizes the innovation and creativity of new talent in the technology industry. It also acknowledges the effort to help consumers through the use of technology with a novel idea that has transformed the transportation community. <br><br>Susan Vaneer<br><br>Exexutive Mananager, Technology Initiatives",

JM Solutions would be happy to offer you our services.<br />\r\nAs I said on the phone, we will help design and program a website that will attract more customers and offer an online sales platform. During this time, we will need to hold meetings with your marketing division in order to best capture your company&rsquo;s goals. Once the website has been completed in mid-February next year, we will hold a training seminar in order to train your employees in the skills necessary to maintain and update your website. The website development and training seminar will cost a total of $32,000. We request that a deposit of 10% be paid in advance. Please see the attached file for detailed costs and schedules.<br />\r\nWe look forward to working with you in the near future. Our staff members will strive to meet all your needs.. Therefore, just let me know when your marketing division is available to meet US in person and discuss some of the details of the project. Please contact me at your convenience.<br />\r\nEric West<br />\r\n<br />\r\n===========================<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em>To:Lillian Ross -lillianross@kingstonsportinggoods.com<br />\r\nFrom:Raymond Wells -raymondwells@kingstonsportinggoods.com<br />\r\nDate:November 4, 10:37 A.M.<br />\r\nSubject:First Quarter Budget<br />\r\nAttachment: Q1_Budget</em><br />\r\n<br />\r\nDear Ms. Ross,<br />\r\nI have attached the current draft for the company&rsquo;s budget for the first quarter of next year. As you will notice, all of the profits made from this year&rsquo;s back-to-school sale are planned to be spent on billboard advertisements on the main highways. I will call a design team later this afternoon and ask them to create eye-catching images for the advertisement.<br />\r\nAt our last meeting, you mentioned that you would like to review the budget before it is finalized. I have already included employee raises in the first quarter&rsquo;s expenses, but if you can think of anything else, please let me know. I would like to have the budget finalized before next week&rsquo;s planning meeting.<br />\r\nRaymond Wells<br />\r\n<br />\r\n===========================<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em>To:Raymond Wells -raymondwells@kingstonsportinggoods.com<br />\r\nFrom:Lillian Ross -lillianross@kingstonsportinggoods.com<br />\r\nDate:November 4, 10:40 AM<br />\r\nSubject:Emergency Budget Addition</em><br />\r\n<br />\r\nDear Mr. Wells,<br />\r\nI am glad you forwarded me your proposed budget when you did. Just prior to receiving your e-mail, I received an estimate for our planned website development. It looks like it is going to be more expensive than I had anticipated. Although the final bill of $32,000 is not due immediately, we will have to find an extra $3,200 in next year&rsquo;s first quarter budget if we want to proceed with JM Solutions&rsquo; proposal.<br />\r\nIf you have any questions regarding this matter, please just come to my office and we can go over where we can make the tough cuts to come up with this funding.",
