I've also checked into merchant service companies that process credit card payments for small businesses, and I sent you a list of the best features that each company offers. There's one that doesn't charge for the equipment we need to read the credit cards, so that's an attractive feature. But 100 another company allows people to pay at the table using their mobile phones. I think customers would really appreciate that convenience, so I suggest using that one."

First, the site is not as—-143.— as it should be. We recommend updating its appearance and adding information that meets the demands of today's tourists. Note also that your organization's logo is not used consistently —144. —- your Web site. You should also consider supplementing the imagery used to promote the city.-— 145.—. We therefore recommend uploading some professionally made videos featuring the various sattractions Brookside has to offer. —146. —-, we suggest adding a page to the Web site that allows residents and visitors to upload their own photos and videos of city attractions.<br>Please contact me at your earliest convenience to discuss the next steps.<br>Best regards,<br>Shelly Luu Luu Marketing",

While participation is not required, we do hope that everyone will take advantage of this opportunity. Part- and full-time regular employees are eligible for these classes at no cost. All other workers and trainees will be required to pay a small enrollment fee.<br />\r\nLocal nurses from Union City Hospital will run the classes on-site, so you do not have to travel anywhere. Classes will be held the first Friday morning of each month, and the class topics will change each month. The class topics in order, starting in September and going through December, will be as follows: Easy Stretching, Good Food Choices, Tips for Better Sleep, and Starting an Exercise Group.<br />\r\nSupervisor approval is necessary. The first step is to complete a class request form and send it to the Benefits Department. If you have any questions, contact our benefits counselors Don Herrell at ext. 249 or Leah Katzen at ext. 199.<br />\r\n<strong>=========================</strong><br />\r\n@PS@/kstoeic/images/1058135_1584785137721.png@PE@",

I’m with the electrical contractors at the former Millway train station site now. The electrical system was in worse shape than we had originally thought. The rewiring and upgrades are going to cost more than expected because we want to modernize while still retaining the historical integrity of the building.I’ll send over the estimate as soon as I receive it. I’m hoping that all the work will be completed so that we can open as planned in May.<br>======================================<br><b>New Hotel to Open in South Wales</b><br> CARDIFF (18 April)—The Millway Road Hotel is scheduled to open on 14 May. The building  was once a busy train station that was designed by Arthur Lewison over 150 years ago.<br> For almost three decades the building had been left unoccupied. It was purchased two years ago by Steffan Griffiths, president of Griffiths Hoteliers.<br>According to project coordinator Fausto Forletti, the old building required extensive renovation not only to turn it into a hotel but also to update the electrical, heating, and plumbing systems.<br> The hotel has 25 guest rooms, a meeting room, and a restaurant with banquet facilities. All of Mr. Griffths' facilities are noted for their world-class dining experiences. The hotel’s Bayside Cafe has award-winning Welsh chef Mal Davies to create a menu and oversee the restaurant.<br> In the near future, Mr. Griffiths plans to expand the property’s garden. For information and reservations, visit www.millwayroadhotel.co.uk. <br>======================================<br>✩✩✩✩<br><b>Millway Road Hotel</b><br>Review posted by Mi-Yeon Ko<br>I recently attended a small conference at the Millway Road Hotel, which opened in June. As a computer technician, I was pleasantly surprised to find that it had such up-to-date facilities. Both my room and the meeting room had more than enough electrical outlets to plug-in equipment and charge mobile phones and computers. The complimentary wireless internet service was easy to access. On top of that, the food was delicious and the guest rooms were beautiful",
