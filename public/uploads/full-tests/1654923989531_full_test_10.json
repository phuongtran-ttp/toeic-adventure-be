The book is heavily marketed to young people, and much of the book's introductory material is geared toward them. However, the concepts elucidated by Ms. Li are reflected in the experiences of many an established business executive. --- [1] ---. The basic premise of the book is that in order to fulfill one's true potential, a person must be willing to take calculated risks. As founder and CEO of a large advertising firm, I can attest to this idea. <br>Taking risks was not something I learned to do overnight. --- [2] ---. In fact, I spent the early years of my career firmly in my comfort zone, avoiding any major decisions that did not have a predictable outcome. What I eventually realized is that by doing this, I was effectively preventing my business from growing to its true potential. --- [3] ---. It was not until I started pursuing new opportunities strategically and stopped worrying about the occasional mistake that my company developed into the multimillion-dollar firm it is today. It was a change in mindset that make all the difference, but it took me years to figure out. <br>For this reason, I am particularly pleased that Ms. Li is presenting this idea to those who may become the business leaders of tomorrow. --- [4] ---. In twelve clear and engaging chapters, Ms. Li narrates the experiences of several of today's big names in business. Each chapter choses with exercises designed to help readers assess their own level of risk aversion. The book concludes with a thought-provoking chapter on approaching risk responsibly that will be as helpful to people well along in their careers as it will be for those who are just starting out. For me, it was a welcome reminder of what I have learned over the years. <br><br>- Karsten Ward",

Please contact us today to schedule your personal-training sessions!<br />\r\nAs a reminder, we offer one-on-one training for power yoga, Pilates, weight training, and power lifting. If you should choose to make personal training a regular part of your fitness routine, packages start at only $70 per month in addition to your monthly membership due.<br />\r\nYour partner in health,<br />\r\nJanie Park<br />\r\nJanie Park, Membership Manager<br />\r\n<br />\r\n==========================<br />\r\n<strong>Personal-Training Schedule for Next Week</strong><br />\r\n<strong>March 4-8</strong><br />\r\n<strong>Employee:</strong> Kevin Pinto<br />\r\n<strong>Location:</strong> Devenport Central\r\n\r\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width:78px;\">&nbsp;</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width:120px;\"><strong>Monday</strong></td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width:99px;\"><strong>Tuesday</strong></td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width:109px;\"><strong>Wednesday</strong></td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width:123px;\"><strong>Thursday</strong></td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width:113px;\"><strong>Friday</strong></td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width:78px;\"><strong>8:00 A.M.</strong></td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width:120px;\">&nbsp;</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width:99px;\">Stacey Lin<br />\r\n\t\t\tPower Yoga</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width:109px;\">Ron Mapleton<br />\r\n\t\t\tPower Yoga</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width:123px;\">&nbsp;</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width:113px;\">Kim Dobbs<br />\r\n\t\t\tWeight Training</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width:78px;\"><strong>9:00 A.M.</strong></td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width:120px;\">PilarHernandez<br />\r\n\t\t\tWeight Training</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width:99px;\">&nbsp;</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width:109px;\">&nbsp;</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width:123px;\">&nbsp;</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width:113px;\">&nbsp;</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width:78px;\"><strong>10:00 A.M</strong></td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width:120px;\">&nbsp;</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width:99px;\">&nbsp;</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width:109px;\">&nbsp;</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width:123px;\">Jean-Luc Curran<br />\r\n\t\t\tPower Lifting</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width:113px;\">&nbsp;</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width:78px;\"><strong>11:00 A.M.</strong></td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width:120px;\">&nbsp;</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width:99px;\">Jaylon Hill<br />\r\n\t\t\tPower Yoga</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width:109px;\">&nbsp;</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width:123px;\">&nbsp;</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width:113px;\">&nbsp;</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</tbody>\r\n</table>",

The new playground will allow children to play and enjoy themselves when they are not at school. <br><br>Cranton is proud to be the recipient of this grant and plans to apply for more grants in the future to improve the living conditions of the town and attract more residents",

The service allows users to go online and browse hundreds of recipes. They select the recipes they like and have the ingredients, with cooking instructionsshipped to them on a weekly basis. Ms. Mishra first thought of the idea she observed her friends&rsquo; hectic lives. &ldquo;My friends were too busy to plan, shop, and cook for themselves,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;Most nights they would go to a restaurant and get takeout food. Some wanted to cook at home in their kitchens but didn&rsquo;t feel confident in their abilities.&rdquo; Ms. Mishra has found a way to streamline the whole process. Fine Fresh Foods works with local suppliers&mdash;often small farms&mdash;that are required to be organic. The focus on working with local partners, as well as the convenience and reasonable price of the service, has made the business extremely popular. At the moment, Fine when Fresh Foods delivers only within Kelowna but expansion to other areas is planned in the coming year.<br />\r\n<strong>=========================</strong>\r\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"width:638px;\">Pennington Farm is teaming up with Fine Fresh Foods!
