The hosing was listed as capable of handling up to 1,000 pounds of pressure per square inch (psi). My company, Advanced Dynamic Cleaning, refitted all of our pressure washers with your hosing at considerable cost and time. Every single one of our pressure washers failed somewhere along the hosing from the joint of the gun to the compressor. Our compressors only create 500 psi, so I have to conclude that there is some defect in the design of your hose. I would like to get a refund of my purchase or a replacement of my order with hosing that meets industry standards. I have included my purchase order and a copy of the invoice.<br><br>Sincerely,<br>Jose Ramos<br>===========================<br><br>To:Jose Ramos - jramos.zipnet.com <br>From: Raquel Jenkins- cservice@starproducts.com <br>Date:October 16<br>Subject:Defective Hose<br><br>Dear Mr. Ramos,<br><br>We have received your report of a defective hose and reviewed the attached documents. We really value your business and hate that you went through such a waste of time and energy with our hosing. However, I am afraid to say that the mistake may be on your end. In looking over your purchase, you clearly ordered XP100 hosing X 5,000 yards. If you look at the specs for that hosing, it is only rated at appropriate for 100 psi. This could explain why all of your hosing failed. What I can offer you is an exchange of the remaining XP100 hosing in your inventory for a hosing more appropriate to your needs. We will do this at no charge and pay for the shipping as a show of our appreciation for your business. Please fill out the purchase order that I have attached and include it with the XP100 hosing when you ship it back to US for exchange.<br><br>Thank you,<br>Raquel Jenkins<br>===========================<br>@PS@/onthisinhvien.appspot.com/images/6789034_1592552433067.png@PE@<br>===========================",

JM Solutions would be happy to offer you our services.<br />\r\nAs I said on the phone, we will help design and program a website that will attract more customers and offer an online sales platform. During this time, we will need to hold meetings with your marketing division in order to best capture your company&rsquo;s goals. Once the website has been completed in mid-February next year, we will hold a training seminar in order to train your employees in the skills necessary to maintain and update your website. The website development and training seminar will cost a total of $32,000. We request that a deposit of 10% be paid in advance. Please see the attached file for detailed costs and schedules.<br />\r\nWe look forward to working with you in the near future. Our staff members will strive to meet all your needs.. Therefore, just let me know when your marketing division is available to meet US in person and discuss some of the details of the project. Please contact me at your convenience.<br />\r\nEric West<br />\r\n<br />\r\n===========================<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em>To:Lillian Ross -lillianross@kingstonsportinggoods.com<br />\r\nFrom:Raymond Wells -raymondwells@kingstonsportinggoods.com<br />\r\nDate:November 4, 10:37 A.M.<br />\r\nSubject:First Quarter Budget<br />\r\nAttachment: Q1_Budget</em><br />\r\n<br />\r\nDear Ms. Ross,<br />\r\nI have attached the current draft for the company&rsquo;s budget for the first quarter of next year. As you will notice, all of the profits made from this year&rsquo;s back-to-school sale are planned to be spent on billboard advertisements on the main highways. I will call a design team later this afternoon and ask them to create eye-catching images for the advertisement.<br />\r\nAt our last meeting, you mentioned that you would like to review the budget before it is finalized. I have already included employee raises in the first quarter&rsquo;s expenses, but if you can think of anything else, please let me know. I would like to have the budget finalized before next week&rsquo;s planning meeting.<br />\r\nRaymond Wells<br />\r\n<br />\r\n===========================<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em>To:Raymond Wells -raymondwells@kingstonsportinggoods.com<br />\r\nFrom:Lillian Ross -lillianross@kingstonsportinggoods.com<br />\r\nDate:November 4, 10:40 AM<br />\r\nSubject:Emergency Budget Addition</em><br />\r\n<br />\r\nDear Mr. Wells,<br />\r\nI am glad you forwarded me your proposed budget when you did. Just prior to receiving your e-mail, I received an estimate for our planned website development. It looks like it is going to be more expensive than I had anticipated. Although the final bill of $32,000 is not due immediately, we will have to find an extra $3,200 in next year&rsquo;s first quarter budget if we want to proceed with JM Solutions&rsquo; proposal.<br />\r\nIf you have any questions regarding this matter, please just come to my office and we can go over where we can make the tough cuts to come up with this funding.",

You indicated that the ice dispenser on the door of the fridge has stopped functioning. Actually, several customers have reported the same problem. It turned out that the manufacturers made an error in the production process. Fortunately, this problem can easily be fixed by one of our technicians. Currently, our technicians are available Monday, Wednesday, and Thursday next week. Please specify what day and what time works for you.<br />\r\nAdditionally, if your refrigerator is under warranty, this repair will be absolutely free. Please let us know your warranty number so we can verify this before sending a technician to your house.<br />\r\nWe apologize for this inconvenience.
