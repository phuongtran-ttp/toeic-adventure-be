Maybe one day I'll find a dog that I really want.” - [4] -<br>Because of the success, the Blakes are considering expanding by purchasing the adjacent shops. “We need more space to fit all our customers and the animals,” explained Kevin. “It can get very crowded at times.” The Blakes are looking to renovate the dog café next month and the cat café during the fall",

The most serious violation concerned the improper storage and labeling of food. All ingredients stored for later use must be labeled with an exact date and detailed contents. If we do not label containers properly, spoiled food could accidently be served to customers. We received relatively low grades for employee hygiene and the cleanliness of our facilities. All employees are required to wear their uniform and hairnet at all times and wash their hands after every bathroom visit. We also need to mop floors more often and keep them dry. <br>In order to correct these poor situations, I will be posting a checklist that all employees will be required to complete every morning. It will include necessary preparations to ensure that we are not breaking any regulations. This measure will go into effect on January 29. <br>If you have any questions about these changes, please bring them up at the staff meeting tomorrow. <br><br>===========================<br> <br><h3 align = \"center\"> NOTICE TO ALL EMPLOYEES</h3><br>The checklist below must be signed by every employee on every day that they have a shift  at Polito’s Pizza. Only sign the task once it has been completed or checked.

        "text": "<h4 align =\"center\">  Respite for Commuters</h4> A new ride-sharing app in gaining in popularity as bus and taxi fees continue to rise and commuters continue to look for more efficient routers. Jordan Mills, a small business owner who commutes into downtown from his home in Brentwood has to transfer buses twice, then, take the subway to get to his workplace. Not only did he find the commute quite costly and uncomfortable in the rush-hour crowds, he found it time- consuming. But with the availability of the new app Freewheel, he found that he saved time and money with a quick ride available within 5 minutes of flagging for a ride from any location he was at. “This is definitely the future of transportation,” said Jordan. “I can’t get to work and back any other way now”.  <br>Jordan Mills isn't the only commuter who feels this way. An estimated 2000 new commuters in the city of Sherwood alone are expected to use the ride-sharing app within the next year and almost 500 new drivers have signed up to the program. <br>Freewheel is available for download at the Freewheel website and at Miniapp.com and Amacom.com. <br><br>===========================<br><br><p align =\"center\">  www.freewheel.com/history </p> <br>The idea for Freewheel began when Michael Owens and his co-workers first started a carpooling program at the company they worked at. Owens had to transfer the subway three times and the bus twice to get to work and although he could drive, the parking was limited. Fie managed the group by assigning different drivers and mapped out routes to each co-worker’s homes. Fie created an app that everyone could connect and communicate through so that the designated drivers and passengers could easily find each other. Five years later, Freewheel is now a major company with tens of thousands of users, both drivers and commuters around the country. <br>Freewheel is dedicated to keeping the cost of commuting down and the efficiency up. In time, it hopes to bring its services to people around the world. <br> <br> =============================== <br> <br><h4 align =\"center\">  Technology Initiatives </h4><p align =\"center\">  is proud to present the </p><p align =\"center\">  New Innovation Award to: </p><p align =\"center\">  Michael Owens, CEO of Freewheel</p> <br>This award recognizes the innovation and creativity of new talent in the technology industry.

The hosing was listed as capable of handling up to 1,000 pounds of pressure per square inch (psi). My company, Advanced Dynamic Cleaning, refitted all of our pressure washers with your hosing at considerable cost and time. Every single one of our pressure washers failed somewhere along the hosing from the joint of the gun to the compressor. Our compressors only create 500 psi, so I have to conclude that there is some defect in the design of your hose. I would like to get a refund of my purchase or a replacement of my order with hosing that meets industry standards. I have included my purchase order and a copy of the invoice.<br><br>Sincerely,<br>Jose Ramos<br>===========================<br><br>To:Jose Ramos - jramos.zipnet.com <br>From: Raquel Jenkins- cservice@starproducts.com <br>Date:October 16<br>Subject:Defective Hose<br><br>Dear Mr. Ramos,<br><br>We have received your report of a defective hose and reviewed the attached documents. We really value your business and hate that you went through such a waste of time and energy with our hosing. However, I am afraid to say that the mistake may be on your end. In looking over your purchase, you clearly ordered XP100 hosing X 5,000 yards. If you look at the specs for that hosing, it is only rated at appropriate for 100 psi. This could explain why all of your hosing failed. What I can offer you is an exchange of the remaining XP100 hosing in your inventory for a hosing more appropriate to your needs. We will do this at no charge and pay for the shipping as a show of our appreciation for your business. Please fill out the purchase order that I have attached and include it with the XP100 hosing when you ship it back to US for exchange.<br><br>Thank you,<br>Raquel Jenkins<br>===========================<br>@PS@/onthisinhvien.appspot.com/images/6789034_1592552433067.png@PE@<br>===========================",

The following changes will go into effect on January 2:<br>(1) A third bus will be added to our fleet to increase service frequency as well as capacity in case one bus is ever down for maintenance. Buses will now run every 15 minutes instead of 30 minutes.<br>(2) A second campus stop will be added. Besides the current stop at the main administration building on the east side of the Optieris campus, there will be a second stop to better accommodate all our staff.<br>(3) A Service will be added in the evening. It will depart the Optieris campus 30 minutes later than the current last Service of the day.<br>Thanks again for your input. For the sake of our environment, we are proud to facilitate your use of public transportation by making our shuttle bus Service more convenient than ever.<br>===============================<br>@PS@/kstoeic/images/4597009_1584927659218.png@PE@<br>===============================<br>From: Sofia Edgren <sofiaedgren@lekmail.com><br>To: Sharani Khamis s.khamis@optieris.com<br>Subject: Applicant interview at Optieris<br>Date: January 25<br>Dear Ms. Khamis,<br> Thanks for inviting me to an interview with Mr. Rochon next week on the Optieris campus.
