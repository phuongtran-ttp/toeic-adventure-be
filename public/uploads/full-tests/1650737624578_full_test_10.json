Ideally, we would like to have our event on Saturday, December 20. I just have a few questions about your services. First, do you provide decorations? I really want this year’s party to be a hit; it is my first time being responsible for it and I really want to impress the boss. Second do you have a wide range of vegetarian dishes? We have 12 vegetarians on our staff of 35, so it will be important to provide them a full meal, not just appetizers.

Let me answer all of your questions and put your mind at ease. To begin with, we have one team left that can cater you for the 20th of December, so you are in luck! As far as the decorations are concerned, we have several different themes to choose from; please visit our website at www.atasteofclass.com to see pictures of our successful events from the past. They are labeled with themes so you may just choose one that appeals to you. Your final inquiry regarding the vegetarian option will also require some decision making on your part. We offer gourmet dining and are happy to specially prepare 12 vegetarian meals, but that can be a little bit expensive. I don’t know what your budget is, but might I suggest making the entire menu vegetarian? We have an outstanding vegetarian chef, Julia Monroe, who can prepare a full vegetarian buffet so delicious a lion would eat it! This option is also a lot more cost-effective than preparing two separate menus. After reviewing your options, please let me know what choices are best for you.<br><br>Sincerely,<br>Brian Petersen,<br>Booking and Sales Manager A Taste of Class<br><br>===========================<br><br>To:Brian Petersen - bpetersen@atasteofclass.com <br>From:Jason Hostrum - jhostrum@jhfurnishing.com <br>Date:November 22<br>Subject:Office Christmas Party<br><br>Dear Mr. Petersen,<br><br>Thanks for your reply I want to go ahead and book the event for Saturday the 2Oth of December.

The hosing was listed as capable of handling up to 1,000 pounds of pressure per square inch (psi). My company, Advanced Dynamic Cleaning, refitted all of our pressure washers with your hosing at considerable cost and time. Every single one of our pressure washers failed somewhere along the hosing from the joint of the gun to the compressor. Our compressors only create 500 psi, so I have to conclude that there is some defect in the design of your hose. I would like to get a refund of my purchase or a replacement of my order with hosing that meets industry standards. I have included my purchase order and a copy of the invoice.<br><br>Sincerely,<br>Jose Ramos<br>===========================<br><br>To:Jose Ramos - jramos.zipnet.com <br>From: Raquel Jenkins- cservice@starproducts.com <br>Date:October 16<br>Subject:Defective Hose<br><br>Dear Mr. Ramos,<br><br>We have received your report of a defective hose and reviewed the attached documents. We really value your business and hate that you went through such a waste of time and energy with our hosing. However, I am afraid to say that the mistake may be on your end. In looking over your purchase, you clearly ordered XP100 hosing X 5,000 yards. If you look at the specs for that hosing, it is only rated at appropriate for 100 psi. This could explain why all of your hosing failed. What I can offer you is an exchange of the remaining XP100 hosing in your inventory for a hosing more appropriate to your needs. We will do this at no charge and pay for the shipping as a show of our appreciation for your business. Please fill out the purchase order that I have attached and include it with the XP100 hosing when you ship it back to US for exchange.<br><br>Thank you,<br>Raquel Jenkins<br>===========================<br>@PS@/onthisinhvien.appspot.com/images/6789034_1592552433067.png@PE@<br>===========================",

I have heard from some friends that your parties are absolutely the best. I really want to make a good impression with my sister's new in-laws; it will be the first time that they join our family for our annual reunion. I just have a few questions for you. First, I need to know how much you would charge for a party for 25 people. I can afford $25 per person, not including alcohol. My family is also a little bit picky with the food they like, so if it is possible for you to send a list of the foods that you provide and the cost per person, I would like to go through it and create my own menu. The last question I have for you is staffing. I really don't want to be cleaning up and doing dishes during the party. Do you provide staff, and if so, how much do you charge for their service? Please write me back so we can get this party planned!<br>All the best, Leroy Jenkins<br>===========================<br>To:Leroy Jenkins - ljenkins@smope.com<br>From:Jason Roberts - jroberts@robertsparties.com <br>Date:Sept. 25<br>Subject:Fall Party<br><br>Dear Mr. Jenkins,<br>So glad to hear that our parties have been such a success. We do have a catering menu for you to choose items from, and feel free to mix and match based on your own budget and tastes. I have included a menu as well as a staffing guide. I recommend hiring the Banquet Captain if you have nerves about the event. Our Banquet Captains are trained to engage and charm the guests at the parties we host, hence our strong reputation.<br>I look forward to making your party a success!<br>Jason Roberts<br>===========================<br>@PS@/onthisinhvien.appspot.com/images/3573701_1592552435835.png@PE@<br>===========================",
