First, we have a group of ten golfers. Now I know most courses generally limit a group to four players to keep up the pace of play, but I was really hoping you could make an exception for us and allow two groups of five. We will even rent golf carts to ensure that we don’t cause a delay. As for the $5 gift cards to the pro shop, I was wondering if they could be pooled together for one large purchase. It is my son’s birthday and I would like to buy him a new putter and they are awfully expensive these days. $50 bucks could go a long way to giving him a great gift! <br>We would like to tee off around 11:30 A.M. on Saturday, July 20th, and then have dinner there at about 6:00 P.M. Please write back to confirm our tee time and answer my queries. Thank you for your time! <br>Have a great day, <br> Logan Mankins",

This year we have updated our conference room with new projectors and more comfortable seating. We will be providing shuttle busses from the airport and a premium buffet in the dining hall as well as an Internet café where guests can use computers or print documents at no cost. For your convenience, we will also be providing useful supplies such as flip charts, 10-foot whiteboards, and projector screens. <br>Once you decide on a date, we ask that you please make a down payment of $1,000 after we see if it is available. The remaining balance should be paid upon your arrival. Also, we ask that as the organizer of the event, you arrive at the conference center a day before the conference begins. This way, any unforeseen circumstances can be taken care of beforehand. <br>We appreciate your business with the Titus Conference Center again. We are looking forward to providing you with the best service possible. <br><br>Stacey Watkins, <br>Director<br><br>===========================<br><br>From:Ann Rose (annrose@putkincomp.com)<br>To: Stacey Watkins (staceywatkins@titus.com)<br>Subject: RE: Conference of Bank Managers <br>Date: February 16<br><br>Dear Mr. Watkins, <br>I am also pleased to be working with you again this year. We would like to reserve your conference space for the weekend of August 15 to 16. Additionally, the down payment will be handled by our financial department. I will have one of the employees contact you soon. <br>There is one thing that I would like to tell you. Actually, last year, some of our attendees were disappointed because the dining hall didn’t offer a variety of vegetarian options. I hope this inconvenience will be dealt with in advance this year. <br><br>Thank you, <br>Ann Rose<br>Organizer, Annual Conference of Bank Managers",

I went ahead and looked into some of our partner hotels in the area, but those properties also are at full occupancy I do hope you are able to find someplace to stay in the city so you can enjoy the festival while you are in town; I just wish it could have been with us. You could try the Executive Inn in Fairview; it is a large hotel and they do have vacancies.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSincere apologies,<br />\r\nAmy Lee<br />\r\nCustomer Service Manager<br />\r\nDream Oasis Hotel",
