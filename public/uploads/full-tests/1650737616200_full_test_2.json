This check-up will be covered by your health insurance, so you do not need to pay any extra fees and this by no means will affect the monthly insurance deductions. -[2] - Included in the envelope is  the detailed information about the new medical program for employees. <br>The medical check-ups will include a blood test, urine test, eye test, height and weight measurements, hearing test, and chest X-rays. - [3] - Please make an appointment with a local clinic. You should have your results given to Karen Leigh at Human Resources by December 30th at the latest. If you fail to get a medical exam, then you may be subject to a fine up to $2000. - [4] - We thank you for your cooperation and hope you abide by the new changes. <br>If you have any further questions or concerns, please contact Karen at leighk@jpindustries.com. <br><br>Sincerely, <br>John Black<br>Executive Manager<br>J&P Industries",

At first, I thought I must have been mistaken, but after checking the list of all parts in the instruction manual, I determined that several parts must have been missing from the kit at the time of sale. I took the kit back to my local Mega Hobby store and a staff member confirmed my suspicion. The Mega Hobby employee was nice enough to exchange my model kit for one that had all of the parts. With the new kit, my son and I were able to put together the model exactly like the picture on the box. I suggest that you go to the Mega Hobby store closest to your home and ask them to exchange your defective product. Be sure to make a note of the order number when you go there.",

However, when I went to that section, I couldn't find any available staff members to assist me. I waited for about half an hour, but no one came to me. I needed help determining what sheet and blanket set would fit the dimensions of my bed but ended up just leaving the store frustrated. I hope you can provide better service to customers so something like this doesn't happen again in the future. X have been a loyal customer of yours for years. If you don't explain why no one helped me, I may have to start shopping at one of your competitors' stores.</i><br><br>===========================<br><br> Hello everybody, I have called this meeting to talk about some of the problems that our new store policy of staying open later has caused. At first, this seemed like a great idea to help customers who worked all day. I know it can be hard to find time to do chores and your shopping when you work from 9 to 5. Unfortunately, this means that we have had to spread our staff too thin until we have hired and trained enough people. As a result, we have been neglecting some of our customers lately. The photocopied Comment and Suggestion Form I have passed out to you all from Willy King sums up our shortcomings better than I ever could. Please give it a read and think about ways we can be made aware of a customer in need, even in a store as large as ours. <br>I understand that with our thin staff, we have to cover more space than we used to, so this meeting isn’t about punishment or blame, it's just about solutions. Please do some brainstorming on this and drop in on me in my office if you think you have an idea; I have to go call Wily King.",

We are planning on expanding our telemarketing department next month, but we don&rsquo;t have enough properly trained employees to fill these new positions. Therefore, we will be transferring some employees from the customer service department to the telemarketing department to solve this problem. As our products are mainly targeted towards children, we are hoping to increase our profits as much as possible for this Christmas season. Please let me know the maximum number of students that you can accommodate at one time.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThank you,<br />\r\nTiffany Tran Zellen Gifts<br />\r\n<br />\r\n===============================<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4 align=\"center\">PROPOSED ACE TRAINING SCHEDULE FOR ZELLEN GIFTS</h4>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\"><b>November 1-5</b></p>\r\n\r\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse\" width=\"90%\">\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td><b>Group Code and Student Numbers </b></td>\r\n\t\t\t<td><b>Monday Sales Strategies </b></td>\r\n\t\t\t<td><b>Tuesday Successful Negotiation </b></td>\r\n\t\t\t<td><b>Wednesday Customers First! </b></td>\r\n\t\t\t<td><b>Thursday Closing the Deal </b></td>\r\n\t\t\t<td><b>Friday Start Polite, Stay Polite </b></td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Red Team 10 people</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>9:00 &ndash; 11:00</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>9:00-11:30</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>8:00 &ndash; 10:30</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>8:00 &ndash; 11:00</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>9:00 -11:00</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Blue Team 10 people</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>1:00 &ndash; 3:00</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>1:00 &ndash; 3:00</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>1:00 &ndash; 3:00</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>1:00 &ndash; 3:00</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>1:00 &ndash; 3:00</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Green Team 10 people</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>3:00 &ndash; 5:00</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>3:00 &ndash; 5:00</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>3:00 &ndash; 5:00</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>3:00 &ndash; 5:00</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>3:00 &ndash; 5:00</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>White Team 10 people</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>5:00 &ndash; 7:00</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>5:00 &ndash; 7:00</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>5:00 &ndash; 7:00</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>5:00 &ndash; 7:00</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>5:00 &ndash; 7:00</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHere is our proposed schedule for transitioning your customer service staff into successful telemarketers. You can see that we have an ambitious amount of material to cover, but I am confident it will be a success. We have tried to balance your need for a swift transition with your need to continue running Zellen Gifts while the training is in session. Therefore, we divided your staff into groups and staggered them throughout the day. This will result in better student-to-trainer numbers for your staff, and it should cause minimal disruptions in your business. We look forward to a great week of training!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJoshua York<br />\r\nAce Training Coordinator</josh@acestafftraining.com></tifftran@zellengifts.com>",
