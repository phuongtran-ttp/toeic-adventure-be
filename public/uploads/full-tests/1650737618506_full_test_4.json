Over the years it has remained a local favorite hangout for the residents of the city and soon captured the eyes of tourists driving through. - [2] - Bill Jr. took over the business and expanded the shop to keep up with the demand of locals and tourists. Northshore Creamery was even selected as a top-ten shop to visit by Travel 8c Tour Magazine. <br>In 1988, Northshore Creamery was featured in the hit Hollywood movie Future Then and Now, which made it the top ice cream shop to visit by out-of-towners and tourists. - [3] - Efforts were made by various corporations to buy the business from the Bradley family, but Bill Jr. and his son William insisted on keeping the business within the family, which pleased the residents of Northshore. - [4] - “We’re keeping things small in scale and we’re slowly expanding,” explained William. “In order to keep the quality of our ice cream fresh and just the way my grandfather created his recipes, we don't want to take any short cuts, which is why we need time.”",

The farmers’ market will be available between 9:00 A.M. and 5:00 P.M. The mayor of Normanville, Tom Daley, will be present to deliver an address at the opening ceremony. A lot of local farmers, food vendors, and street performers will be at the venue. <br>“This vibrant market will give our local farmers a nice place to sell their fresh produce. Additionally, because we cut out some middle processes, our prices are lower than those of average grocery stores,” said Suzy Hammer, executive director of the Normanville Farmers’ Association. <br>Ms. Hammer also mentioned that currently there is not enough parking space to accommodate shoppers. The Normanville Farmers’ Association plans on expanding parking space in the coming months after the market has opened this Saturday. In the meantime, she advises Normanville residents who will visit the market to use public transportation in order to avoid parking difficulties. <br>The Normanville Farmers’ Market is different from other grocery stores that supply mass-produced food products. The market will provide organic produce that is full of essential vitamins and minerals. As you know, the market will also help the local economy. <br>Please come this Saturday and see what the Normanville Farmers’ Market has to offer! <br> Sincerely,<br> Normanville Farmer’s Association",

Previously, he was the chief financial officer at the technology investment firm Esta Resources in San Francisco, California. He assumed the position of CEO at the company—based in Dallas, Texas—just this Monday.

Mr. Cross has an impressive record as a business leader who makes smart decisions,\" commented Lynn Dyer, the director of human resources at Tech Life. \"We have faith that he will lead US in a new direction that will help develop new markets and optimize our company operations in general.\" <br>Steve Cross graduated from Chester University in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, with a master's degree in business administration. He once served as head of the American League of Business Leaders and is a dedicated family man. <br><br>===========================<br><br>To:Steve Cross- scross@techlife.com <br>From:Lynn Dyer - ldyer@techlife.com<br>Subject: Welcome! <br>Date:April 15<br>Dear Mr. Cross, <br><br>It has been almost two years since we met.

JM Solutions would be happy to offer you our services.<br />\r\nAs I said on the phone, we will help design and program a website that will attract more customers and offer an online sales platform. During this time, we will need to hold meetings with your marketing division in order to best capture your company&rsquo;s goals. Once the website has been completed in mid-February next year, we will hold a training seminar in order to train your employees in the skills necessary to maintain and update your website. The website development and training seminar will cost a total of $32,000. We request that a deposit of 10% be paid in advance. Please see the attached file for detailed costs and schedules.<br />\r\nWe look forward to working with you in the near future. Our staff members will strive to meet all your needs.. Therefore, just let me know when your marketing division is available to meet US in person and discuss some of the details of the project.

As you will notice, all of the profits made from this year&rsquo;s back-to-school sale are planned to be spent on billboard advertisements on the main highways. I will call a design team later this afternoon and ask them to create eye-catching images for the advertisement.<br />\r\nAt our last meeting, you mentioned that you would like to review the budget before it is finalized. I have already included employee raises in the first quarter&rsquo;s expenses, but if you can think of anything else, please let me know.

Just prior to receiving your e-mail, I received an estimate for our planned website development. It looks like it is going to be more expensive than I had anticipated.

You indicated that the ice dispenser on the door of the fridge has stopped functioning. Actually, several customers have reported the same problem. It turned out that the manufacturers made an error in the production process. Fortunately, this problem can easily be fixed by one of our technicians. Currently, our technicians are available Monday, Wednesday, and Thursday next week. Please specify what day and what time works for you.<br />\r\nAdditionally, if your refrigerator is under warranty, this repair will be absolutely free. Please let us know your warranty number so we can verify this before sending a technician to your house.<br />\r\nWe apologize for this inconvenience.

It is a little bit unusual that the transaction that caused the overdraft was at an ATM machine a day after you say that you lost your card. Have you given your access pin to anybody recently? I would be happy to pass your request for overdraft relief on to our fraud department, but you will need to file a police report and then send us the case number that the investigating officer gives you. Once we receive this number, we can proceed with our review of your case.<br />\r\nThank you and good day,<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLaura Massey,<br />\r\nCustomer Service Specialist, Stark Bank /customerservice@starkbank.com / ssummers@zippynet.com / ssummers@zippynet.com / customerservice@starkbank.com",
