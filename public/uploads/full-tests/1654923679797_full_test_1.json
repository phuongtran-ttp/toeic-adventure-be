Beginning in November, she will be general manager of City Wheels, a bike-sharing company in Auckland. — [2]—. The move comes at an opportune moment for both Ms. Haas and City Wheels. Ms. Haas had worked for Gear Good in Wellington since the company was founded five years ago but was yearning to return to Auckland, where she grew up. City Wheels was looking for a new leader to oversee its planned expansion from 50 to 75 bike stations in Auckland. —[3] —. “I’m thrilled to join a company that’s important to residents and tourists alike,” Ms. Haas said. <br>The City Wheels system is simple and affordable for occasional use. —[4] —. The first thirty minutes of biking are free, and after that, the cost is $4 per hour or $20 per day.

According to our account data, we see that you did contact us and freeze your accounts, though it looks like it was too late to prevent the withdrawal and subsequent overdraft of your account. It is a little bit unusual that the transaction that caused the overdraft was at an ATM machine a day after you say that you lost your card. Have you given your access pin to anybody recently? I would be happy to pass your request for overdraft relief on to our fraud department, but you will need to file a police report and then send us the case number that the investigating officer gives you. Once we receive this number, we can proceed with our review of your case.<br />\r\nThank you and good day,<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLaura Massey,<br />\r\nCustomer Service Specialist, Stark Bank /customerservice@starkbank.com / ssummers@zippynet.com / ssummers@zippynet.com / customerservice@starkbank.com",

        "text": "April 5&mdash;Clearwater Hospital in downtown Scranton has launched a new pen pal letter-writing program between terminally ill hospital patients and adult volunteers. Hospital Director Zack Chambers, who was recently presented with an Outstanding Leader Award from the National Health Care Alliance, started the program to create stronger connections between the hospital and the community. Mr. Chambers encourages adults of all types and occupations to apply even if they don&rsquo;t feel completely qualified. Simply visit the Clearwater Hospital website and become a member of the hospital free of charge.<br />\r\n&ldquo;I hope through this program, volunteers can form close relationships with patients to help them get through these difficult times in their lives,&rdquo; said Mr. Chambers. He also hopes that the program will lead to more people visiting terminally ill patients in person.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n==========================<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em>Clearwater Hospital<br />\r\nMay 4<br />\r\nMonica Greene<br />\r\n4100 Washington Road<br />\r\nScranton, Wisconsin 54481</em><br />\r\n<br />\r\nDear Ms. Greene,<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI was delighted to receive your letter. I am very excited to have been paired with you as pen pals. I hope we can learn a lot from each other and build a lasting friendship.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs you know, I live in California, which is a long way from Wisconsin. I hope that in the coming months I can find some time off work and visit you. Please let me know when the most convenient time would be for me to meet you.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI look forward to hearing from you,<br />\r\nJessica Wright<br />\r\n<br />\r\n===========================<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDear Jessica,<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou don&rsquo;t know how much I appreciate your kind words. Although the staff at Clearwater are very kind, I feel the need to connect with people who are not part of the staff. My surviving family also live a great distance away, in Florida, and so most of the time I am just communicating with the paid staff or the other patients. I would welcome a visit, if you truly wanted to come, and the best time would be for our meeting is the Thanksgiving holiday party here at the center I suppose. My own family might be here as well. If it is too much for you, or if you can&rsquo;t get the time off of work, don&rsquo;t worry about it too much. I do hope that we can continue to communicate through our letters.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAll the best,<br />\r\nMonica Greene",
